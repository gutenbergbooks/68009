<p><span class="smcap">All</span> Armando knew of sculpture he had
learned from his uncle Daniello, a mountain
craftsman who never chiselled anything
greater than a ten-inch Saint Peter. At
night in the tavern on the craggy height,
with a flask of <i>barbera</i> before him, the old
carver would talk grandly of his doings in
art, while his comrades, patient of the oft-told
tale, nodded their heads in listless but
loyal accord. They all knew very well that
it was young Armando who did most of the
carving, yet they cried “Bravo!” for old
Daniello’s wine was good. And so it had
been for a long time. While the lad chipped
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>all day in a little workshop perched beyond
the nether cloud shadows, his uncle passed
the hours in Genoa, where, by sharp wits and
bland tongue, he transmuted the marble into
silver.</p>

<p>But Armando had a soul that looked far
above the gleaming tonsures of ten-inch
Saint Peters. Wherefore he was unhappy.
When his twentieth birthday dawned it
seemed to him that his life had been a failure.
One morning, after a night of much
<i>barbera</i> and noisy gasconade, old Daniello
did not wake up, and two days afterward
they laid him to rest in the sloping
graveyard in the gorge by the olive-oil
mill.</p>

<p>Gloomily Armando weighed the situation,
standing by the mullioned window of
the room wherein he had toiled so long and
ignobly. Far in the western distance he
could see the ships that seemed to glide
with full sails across the mountains. The
serene midsummer vapours, pendulous above
the Mediterranean, were visible, but the sea
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>upon which their shadows fell and lingered
was hidden from his view by a thicket of
silver firs. Southward the trees stood lower,
and over their tops, where tired sea gulls circled,
he gazed sadly toward the jumble of
masonry that is Genoa.</p>

<p>Miles below in the sun glare the city lay
this morning as Heine found it decades ago,
like the bleached skeleton of some thrown-up
monster of the deep. And a monster it
was in the sight of the poor lad who looked
down from the heights of Cardinali&mdash;but a
monster that he would conquer, even as
Saint George, champion of Genoa, had conquered
the dragon in ages far agone. Yes,
he would strike off for evermore the chains
that fettered him to ten-inch Saint Peters,
and mount to the white peaks of art! In
the Apennine hamlet he had lived all his
days, and never heard of Balzac; but he
clinched his fist, and, with eyes set upon the
cluster of chimney pots at the mountain’s
foot, made his vow:</p>

<p>“In this room, O Genoa! will I bring
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>forth a marble that shall make you do me
honour.”</p>

<p class="p2b">Then he felt uplifted&mdash;as though he had
burned the bridges that hung between his
old ignominy and the straight path to fame
and riches. The vow was still fervid and
strong within him when, two days afterward,
he beheld in a shop window of Genoa a
photograph of Falguière’s great marble,
Juno and the Peacock. Before the divine
contours of Jupiter’s helpmeet the simple-hearted
graver of saintly images stood enchanted.
Presently, as though spoken by a
keen, mysterious voice from the upper air,
there pierced his consciousness the word
“Replica!” Again and again was it repeated,
each time with a new insistence.
Ah, a copy of this in marble! Yes; with
such a masterpiece he would begin his
ascent to the white peaks. He bought the
photograph, put it in his pocket and kept it
there until he was beyond the city’s bounds
and trudging up the causeway toward Cardinali.
Now and then he took out the picture,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
regarded it fondly, and, peering back
at the town, asked himself if Genoa would
look the same when his Juno and the Peacock
should be there. Would the soft murmur
of that drowsy mass have the same
note? Would the people move with the
same pace, eat, sleep, and drink as they had
always done? He was inclined to think
they would not.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="illo1"><img src="images/i_004.jpg" width="400" alt="Would Genoa be the same when his Juno and Peacock
should be there?" title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">Would Genoa be the same when his Juno and Peacock<br />
should be there?</p>

<p class="p2">For a twelvemonth, through early tides
and late shifts, he modelled and chipped: in
winter, when the demoniac mistral, raging
all about him, shook the workshop and
snapped the boughs of the cypresses; in
summer, when the ortolan and the wood-thrush
cheered him with their song. And
the little group of neighbours, from whom
he guarded his great artistic secret, marvelled
that no more Saint Peters came forth from
their time-honoured birthplace.</p>

<p>Only two persons in Cardinali besides
Armando had knowledge of the momentous
affair that was going forward. One was
Bertino, a fair-haired youth of the sculptor’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>age, who busied his hands by day plaiting
Lombardian straw into hats, and his head
by night dreaming of America and showering
cornucopias of gold. He was Armando’s
bosom friend. The other confidant was
Bertino’s foster sister Marianna, somewhat
demure for a mountain lass, and subject to
thinking spells. Beauty she had, notably
on feast days, when she walked to church
with a large-rayed comb in her braided
chestnut waterfall, a gorgeous striped apron,
and clattering half-sabots, freshly scraped
and polished to a shine. She, too, plaited
straw, and with it wove many love thoughts
and sighs for Armando.</p>

<p>At last the stately goddess and her long-tailed
companion stood triumphant in all the
candour of marble not wholly spotless. The
hour of unveiling it to the astonished gaze
of Bertino and Marianna was the happiest
that the ruler of Armando’s fate permitted
him for many a day thereafter. The bitterness
and crushing disillusion came on the
day that he loaded the carved treasure on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>the donkey cart of Sebastiano the carrier,
and followed Juno and the Peacock down
the mountain pass to the haven of his sweet
anticipation.</p>

<p>“He has been saving up his Saint
Peters,” said Michele the Cobbler to a group
of mystified neighbours as the cart passed
his shop. “See, he has a box full of them.
I wonder how many saints one can cut out
in a year. Ah, well, it was not thus that
his uncle Daniello did, nor his father before
him. Shall I tell you what I think, my
friends? Well, I think that boy is going
wrong.”</p>

<p>“Ah, <i>si</i>,” was the unanimous voice.</p>

<p>“May your success be great, Armando
mine!” said Bertino when they parted at the
first curve of the pass. “Perhaps against
your return I shall have famous news from
America. Who knows? Good fortune be
with you. <i>Addio.</i>”</p>

<p>“The saints be with you to a safe return,”
said Marianna. “<i>Addio</i>, and good
fortune.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>“<i>Addio, carissimi amici.</i>”</p>

<p>Sebastiano the carrier lifted the block
from the wheel and the donkey moved on.
Armando walked behind, keeping a watchful
eye on the thing in the cart, which was
in every shade of the term a reduced replica
of Falguière’s inspiration.</p>

<p>“You must be very careful, Sebastiano,”
said he. “Never in your life have you had
such a valuable load on your cart.”</p>

<p>“Bah!” growled the driver. “Valuable!
How many have you there? Are
they all the same size? Do you mean to
say that I never had a load as valuable as a
boxful of Saint Peters? Oh, <i>bello</i>! Only
last week did I haul a barrel of fine <i>barolo</i>
to the Inn of the Fat Calf. Ah, my dear,
that is a wine. Wee-ah! wee-ah!&mdash;Go
on, you lazy one. That donkey is too
careful.”</p>

<p>They reached their destination in Genoa
without mishap. When the art dealer who
had consented to look at it had bestowed on
Armando’s work of a year a momentary survey,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
he turned to the sculptor, who stood hat
in hand, and regarded him earnestly.</p>

<p>“Who told you to do this, dear young
man?” he asked, removing his eyeglasses.</p>

<p>“Nobody, signore. It was my own idea.”</p>

<p>The merchant turned to Juno with a new
interest.</p>

<p>“Not so bad as it might have been,” he
shrugged, moving aside to view the figures in
profile. “What is your name? Signor Corrini.
Well&mdash;but, my dear young man, it will
be a long time, perhaps years, before you are
able to do work of this kind. Naturally, I
could not permit it to remain in my place.
What else have you done? Something
smaller, I suppose.”</p>

<p>Armando strove hard to keep them back,
but the sobs choked him.</p>

<p>While the merchant stood by, offering
words meant to comfort, but which added to
his anguish, he replaced the marble in the
box and nailed the lid before rousing Sebastiano
from his <i>siesta</i> in the cart.</p>

<p>“It all comes of keeping the saints too
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>long,” grumbled the carrier, as he helped lift
Juno and the Peacock back into the cart.
“Never did your uncle Daniello have any
thrown on his hands&mdash;not he. Ah, there
was a man of affairs!”</p>

<p>The donkey tugged at the chain traces,
moved the wheels a spoke or two, then
stopped and looked around at the driver,
wagging his grizzled ears in mute but eloquent
disapproval of hauling a load skyward.
But after duly weighing the matter, assisted
by several clean-cut hints from a rawhide
lash, he set off at his own crablike pace.</p>

<p>The first turning of the highway attained,
Armando paused and gazed on the city below,
his heart aflood with bitterness. Far to
the westward the sun, in variant crimson
tones, lay hidden under the sea, like the last,
loftiest dome of some sinking Atlantis. In
every white hamlet of the slopes the Angelus
was ringing. Night birds from Africa
wheeled around the towering snares set for
them by the owners of the olive terraces and
villas, whose yellow walls in long stretches
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>bordered the steep route. With his little
group of living and inanimate companions
Armando trudged along, his head bowed,
silent as the marble in the cart. The gloaming
quiet was unbroken, save for the gluck
of the wheels and the distant chant of the
belfries.</p>

<p>They were yet a long way from the outermost
cot of Cardinali when a resounding
shout brought the donkey to a standstill and
startled Sebastiano into a “<i>Per Bacco</i>!”</p>

<p>It was the voice of Bertino. He was
rounding a curve in the road, brandishing a
piece of folded paper, and clattering toward
them as fast as he could in his heavy wooden
shoes. His radiant face proclaimed that
something had happened to fill him with
gladness. A few paces behind came Marianna,
but in her eyes there was no token of
joy. She had beheld the loaded cart.</p>

<p>“Long live my uncle!” cried Bertino,
grasping Armando’s hand. “The letter has
come, and I’m off for America. Think of
it, Armando <i>mio</i>, I, Bertino Manconi, going
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>to America! It is no longer a dream. I
am to go&mdash;go, do you understand? The
money is here, and nothing can stop me.
But come, you do not seem happy to hear
of my great good fortune. I know, dear
friend, you are sorry to lose me. Bah! one
can not live in the mountains all his life, and
perhaps you too will be there some day&mdash;some
day when your Juno is sold. To-night
all my friends shall drink a glass of <i>spumante</i>
to my voyage&mdash;yes, the real <i>spumante</i> of
Asti. At the Inn of the Fat Calf will I
say <i>addio</i>, for I set sail to-morrow. Tell
me, now, do you not count me a lucky
devil?”</p>

<p>“You are lucky,” said Armando sadly.
“I wish I could go. My own country does
not want me.”</p>

<p>Marianna walked at the tail of the cart.
While her brother was talking she had lifted
the box in the hope that it might, after all,
be only the empty one that he was bringing
back; but the weight of it told her the truth
she had read in Armando’s face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>“The beast!” she said, “to refuse such
a fine thing as that. What did&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Armando signalled silence, and pointed
to Sebastiano, who walked ahead. By this
time Bertino understood, and he too exclaimed:</p>

<p>“The beast!”</p>

<p>“Who’s a beast?” asked the muleteer.</p>

<p>“That art merchant, whoever he is.
Bah! What would you have? In this
country a fellow has no chance. What a
fool one is to stay here!”</p>

<p>“No, no; the country is good,” said Sebastiano,
shaking his head and jerking a
thumb toward Armando. “But what can
you expect when one keeps his Saint Peters
a whole year?”</p>

<p>The others exchanged knowing glances
and followed on in silence. The rest of the
way it was plain to all who saw Bertino pass
that he was thinking very hard, and with the
product of this mental exertion he was fairly
bursting by the time they reached Armando’s
home, for he had not dared to speak in presence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
of the carrier. When Juno and the
Peacock had been restored to their birthplace
he began:</p>

<p>“Now, listen to me, <i>amici</i>, for I have an
idea. I am going to America. Is not that
so?”</p>

<p>“Yes; you are going to America. Well?”</p>

<p>“Patience. You know that as the assistant
of my uncle in his great shop in New
York I shall be rather a bigger man than I
am here. Who knows what I may become?”</p>

<p>“Ah, <i>si</i>; who knows?” said Marianna.</p>

<p>“Listen. Now, let us have a thought
together. Here is Armando. He is a fine
sculptor. We know that. The proof is
here.” He tapped the big box. “But in
Genoa they are too stupid and too poor to
buy his magnificent work. Now, in America
people are neither stupid nor poor.
Why can he not make a fortune in America?”</p>

<p>“I can’t go to America,” said Armando.</p>

<p>“No; he can’t go to America,” chimed
in Marianna. “What a foolish idea!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>“Excuse me. Who wants him to go to
America? He stays in Cardinali and makes
statues. I go to New York and sell them.
Now, my dears, do you see which way the
swallow is flying?”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But nothing. Do you think that I,
who sail for America to-morrow, do not
know what I am about? Listen. What do
you suppose I was doing on the way up?
Well, I was thinking. I have thought it all
out. I ask you this, Armando: Juno and
the Peacock you made from a photograph?
Very well; can you not make other things
from photographs? From New York I
shall send you the picture of some great
American; some one as great as&mdash;as great
as&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Crespi,” suggested Armando, now interested
in the project.</p>

<p>“Crespi? No, no. Some one greater,
like&mdash;like&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“D’Annunzio,” Armando ventured again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>“Bah! Who is he? I mean some one
very great, like&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know!” cried Marianna. “Like the
Pope!”</p>

<p>“No, no,” persisted Bertino. “It must
be some man as big as Garibaldi. That’s
it. But not a dead Garibaldi. He must be
alive, so that I may sell him the bust that
you will make of him. What would you do
with a man like that, for example?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Armando, pausing and looking
up at the ceiling, as though weighing the
matter carefully, “I should make a very fine
bust of such a man.”</p>

<p>“Bravo!” cried Bertino. “With a piece
of your best work for a sample, how long
should I be getting orders for more? Not
many days, I promise. And the Americans
have gold. What say you, my friend? Is
it not a grand idea?”</p>

<p>“<i>Si, si</i>; a grand idea.”</p>

<p>In truth it loomed before Armando as
the chance of his life. Now as ardent as
the other, he agreed to begin work upon a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>bust in marble so soon as he should receive
from America a photograph of the chosen
subject. When finished he would send it to
New York, there to be put on exhibition
and offered for sale.</p>

<p>That afternoon the Saale steamed from
Genoa Bay with Bertino a steerage passenger.
Some time after the ship had swung
from her quay Armando and Marianna
looked from the studio window over the cypress
fringe toward the gap in the mountains
that shows the sails of ships but conceals the
Mediterranean’s waves. Presently a black
bar of smoke moving lazily across the aperture
told them that he was on his way.</p>

<p>Near the window a block of Carrara
marble glistened pure and white in the sunlight.
Armando wondered what manner of
being he should release from it&mdash;a President,
a money king, or a great American beauty?</p>

<span class="smaller">CASA DI BELLO</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> banked fire of America’s Sabbath
gave its quiet to Bowling Green the day that
Bertino landed in New York. It was not
the New York he had seen so often from
the heights of Cardinali. The cloud-piercing
houses had always loomed in his dream
pictures, but no returned exile had ever told
him that they filled the soul with this nameless
dread. He longed to be in Mulberry,
which all travellers agreed was the next best
thing to being in Italy. With a goatskin
box under one arm, a tawny cotton umbrella
pressed by the other, and his left hand
clutching the knotted ends of a kerchief
holding more luggage, he set out from the
Barge Office. In the band of his narrow-brimmed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
black soft hat&mdash;the precious adornment
of festal days&mdash;stood a gray turkey
feather, and about his bare neck in sailor
noose was tied a cravat of satin, green as the
myrtle of his native steeps. As he strode
up Broadway, past old Trinity and Wall
Street, the heavy fall of his hobnailed boots
started the echoes of the New World’s financial
centre.</p>

<p class="p2b">A flock of fellow-pilgrims clattered by at
high speed in care of a guide, who charged
five cents a head for piloting them safely to
the Italian colony. The hatless women, burdened
with babies and heavy sacks, struggled
bravely to keep up with the men, who carried
the umbrellas. Bertino fell in behind,
and soon they turned the corner of Franklin
Street. Here they got their first glimpse of
Mulberry, which lay clearly visible in the
distance at the foot of a hill whose summit
is Broadway. Beneath the Bridge of Sighs,
which spans the street at the Tombs Prison,
forming an arching frame for the picture,
they could see the pleasant lawn of Paradise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>Park. It was a bright afternoon, and the
broad patch of greensward gleamed like a
great emerald down there in the sunlight, and
the low-roofed houses all around, with the
sun’s fire in their window panes, had a homelike
countenance. This was not the image
their minds had wrought of Mulberry, where
travellers said the people were herded in
pens that knew not the light of day. How
strange that no one had ever told them it
was so cheerful and <i>bello</i>! But when they
reached the heart of the quarter they had no
more thrills from the contemplation of natural
beauty. Here the air throbbed with
the <i>staccato</i> cadence of south Italian <i>patois</i>.
The signs over the shops were no longer
gibberish, and Bertino blessed the day that
he, Armando, and Marianna had paid the
mountain pedagogue three liras to teach
them words of ordinary size.</p>

<p class="caption">Bertino’s arrival at Paradise Park.</p>

<p class="p2">Mulberry was in its accustomed Sunday
manner. Nearly all the shops were closed,
and their faces, so smiling on week days in
scarlet wreaths of dried peppers, clusters of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>varnished buffalo cheeses and festoons of
Bologna <i>salame</i>, now frowned in shabby
black or dark-brown shutters. Madre Chiara’s
bower, evergreen on working days with
chicory and dandelion salad and Savoy cabbage,
had vanished with its owner. No
gossip-hungry women, with primed ears,
bent about the basket of the garlic seller on
China Hill, for she was out with everybody
to-day in her best clothes. The crippled
beggar at the hydrant was not missing, but
he shivered in the May sunshine because
Sara the Frier of Pepper Pods was not
there with her pail of fire. Another important
brazier was in Sunday retirement&mdash;that
of old Cantolini the Gondolier, and in consequence
there floated on the air no suave
odour of cooking pine cones, whose seed
the Napolitani of the Basso Porto so love
to munch.</p>

<p>In the rear courts, where gamblers at
<i>morra</i> bawled and capered like madmen,
rows of pushcarts, their stubby shafts in the
air, told of a twenty-four-hour truce in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>strategic fray waged between the peddler
army and the artful police. The narrow ribbon
of sky between the tall tenements had a
Sunday look; it was not mottled with shirts
of many patches hung out to dry, and the
iron fire escapes, stripped of their week-day
wash things in the general sprucing up, gave
to the eye here and there the colours of
Italy. The dingy <i>caffès</i>, from whose tenebrous
depths tobacco smoke poured with the
scent of viands, were crowded with the Calabriani,
the Siciliani, and the Napolitani of
the rural districts visiting Mulberry for an
innocent spree.</p>

<p>The jewelry shops were open and doing
a lively trade. Young men bought wedding
rings and tried them on the fingers of
their promised wives, while faint-hearted
bachelors, at the same counter, parted with
their hard-earned coin for little silver-tipped
horns against the evil eye. At the door a
brawny flower woman in spickest gingham
held a basket of dahlias fresh, mingled with
carnations and asters that had lost the bloom
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>of first youth. It was a sure vantage ground
for her traffic. The mating couples, proud
in their ownership of the wedlock band,
stopped at the basket, every one, and close-fisted
indeed was the future husband who
did not hand a posy to his bride elect.</p>

<p>As the wondering Bertino passed, bearded
men in the rôle of newsboys bellowed their
wares in his ears: “<i>Il Progresso! L’Araldo!
L’Italiano in America! Due soldi!</i>” Literature
got scant nourishment, but tobacco-selling
throve, and the man without a lengthy
rat-tail cigar in his mouth was marked among
his fellows. They were all in their smartest
clothes. Starched shirts were too numerous
to give their wearers distinction, and not a few
of the clean-shaved necks fretted within stiff
collars. Here and there dark-skinned young
sparks with red neckties puffed cigarettes
and showed fine in apparel that smacked of
Bowery show-windows. Scarcely a woman
was there from whose ears did not hang
long pendants of gold, nor a feminine head
that did not gleam in oily smoothness.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>Shawls woven in the gaudy hues and fantastic
patterns of Italian looms splashed the
throng with colour, and a few of those large-rayed
combs that Apennine maidens love to
wear glinted in the sunshine of Paradise
Park. Much courting went forward on the
park benches, the fond ones caring not an
atom for the stare of colder eyes, but retaining
their entwined pose in sweet oblivion to
the rest of Mulberry.</p>

<p>The company in charge of the five-cent
guide followed their leader into a broad
alley, and Bertino was left alone in the concourse,
at loss whither to turn. Not a soul
gave the least heed to him. Those whom
he asked to point him to 342 Mulberry
Street, his uncle’s abode, passed on shaking
their heads and mumbling something in
broad Sicilian or Neapolitan which the
young Genovese did not understand. Some
sighed as they made the sign of not knowing,
as though that number were the darkest
of mysteries. At length a gleam of light
came over one face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>“I know,” said the man, a young fellow
decked in Sunday corduroy. “It is Casa
Di Bello.”</p>

<p>“Yes; Giorgio Di Bello is the name of
my uncle.”</p>

<p>“Your uncle? Santa Maria, signore!
Let me carry your trunk.”</p>

<p>But Bertino only hugged the goatskin
closer, the tales of Mulberry sharks current
in every mountain hamlet of Italy being
vivid in his mind.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you the house, anyway,” said
the man of knowledge, and Bertino followed.</p>

<p>The sidewalk was too narrow for the
buzzing stream. The asphalted roadway had
become the grand promenade, and there the
panorama of Italia’s types unrolled: black
men of Messina, with the hair and skin of
Persia, exiled from Etna’s slopes mayhap
by the glowing lavas that burn up olive
grove and vineyard; red, flat-nosed men and
fair-haired women of Lombardy, driven perchance
from their fertile plains by the ruin
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>that rides grimly on the freshets of the Po,
but brought oftener by the tax collector;
cowherds and clodbreakers of the Roman
Campagna, whose clear-toned dialect found
an antiphonal note in the patter of the gaunt
but often brawny sons of fever-plagued
Maremma. Here and there in the moving
throng strutted a labour <i>padrone</i>, out to
salute and be saluted with lifted hat by all
who prized his favour. One and all they
uncovered as he passed&mdash;sturdy dwarfs from
Calabria and the Basilicata, mere pegs from
the heel and the toe of the Boot; limpid-eyed
mountaineers from the Abruzzi, bronzed
fags of half-African Sicily, riffraff of the
Neapolitan slums; America-mad fishermen
of the Adriatic and Tyrrhene, deserters of a
coinless Arcadia to become hod-slaves with
a bank account.</p>

<p>Slowly but volubly the clans of toil
moved by, unheeded by a little mother
whose life was given for the moment to shining
the heavy gold rings in her baby’s ears.</p>

<p>“<i>Eccola, signore</i>,” said the man in corduroy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
pausing before a house that faced St.
Patrick’s graveyard. “This is Casa Di Bello,
the finest domicile in the colony.”</p>

<p>It was an old-style brick dwelling of two
stories and attic on the northern fringe of
Mulberry&mdash;the only house in the street
whose front was not gridironed with fire
escapes. The low stoop, iron railing, and
massive dadoes, the Ionian door columns of
hard wood, the domed vestibule and generous
width, marked it a rare survivor of the
building era that passed with the stagecoach
and the Knickerbocker&mdash;a well-preserved
ghost of the quarter’s bygone fashion and
respectability.</p>

<p>Bertino looked up and read in bold text
upon a well-polished brass doorplate the
assuring name, “Di Bello.”</p>

<p>“<i>Grazie mille</i>,” he said to his guide. “I
am too poor to make you a present. <i>Grazie
mille.</i>”</p>

<p>The other made off with a long face, but
protesting that he had not expected a present
for such a small service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>Heartened by the nearness of a friend,
Bertino gave the heavy bell handle a stout
pull. Decorously and without undue promptness
the broad-panelled oak swung narrowly,
and the mountaineer looked into the stern
complacency of his aunt Carolina’s eyes.
He was too young to remember this smug
dame of closing forty, who had gone from
Cardinali twelve years before to become
<i>perpetua</i><a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> in the Mulberry parish rectory.
That peaceful career she had forsaken, for
reasons of which we may learn; but the
eight years of churchdom were still in her
head. Nor had she ever lost the outward
badge. She was rotund and well-coloured,
monastic of mien, and sleek as a cathedral
rat.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” she asked, scanning
the lad from his hobnailed soles to the turkey
feather in his hat.</p>

<p>“I am Bertino Manconi, nephew of
Signor Giorgio Di Bello,” he answered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>proudly, unabashed by her poignant stare.
“Are you Angelica the cook?”</p>

<p>When her breath came free she said:
“But it was to-morrow&mdash;Monday.” His
arrival one day ahead of the appointed time
shocked her rubric sense of order and
ignored her ritual of coming events. “And
you come to the door like a Sicilian, baggage
in hand and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ha! Welcome to my house!” cried
a hearty voice at the head of the stairs. “A
hundred welcomes, <i>caro</i> nephew! But what
a stupendous height! Step aside, my sister,
and bid the giant enter. How is this? At
the parish house did they teach you to make
friends wait outside? Well, it is not so at
Casa Di Bello. So you are a day ahead?
Well, so much the better. Ah, what a fine
voyage you must have had!”</p>

<p>It was no longer a voice on the upper
floor, but the form and substance of a
bush-headed, chubby man of dawning fifty,
whose prodigious King Humbert mustache
quaked as he puffed down the staircase as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>best his short legs would permit. He threw
himself upon Bertino, who had to stoop a
little to receive a resonant salutation on each
cheek. Then Carolina bestowed a pair of
stony kisses, first remarking with wooden
seemliness, “Welcome, my nephew.”</p>

<p>At the same moment Angelica the cook,
a mite of a crone with a Roman nose, carried
a steaming soup into the dining room,
set it on the table, and called out in the
shrillest Genovese:</p>

<p>“<i>Ecco, signori</i>; the <i>minestrone</i> is served,
and the most beautiful <i>minestrone</i> I have
made since the Feast of the Mother.”</p>

<p>After his three weeks of steerage fare
Bertino fell upon the dinner with a zest that
delighted his uncle, but dismayed Carolina,
and caused the rims of Angelica’s eyes to
spread until they were as round as the O of
Giotto.</p>

<p>“Well, did you stop to pick up any
gold in the street?” asked Signor Di
Bello, winking at his sister, and sprinkling
grated Parmesan over a ragout of green
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>peppers. “I suppose you have your valise
filled with it.”</p>

<p>“<i>Ma che!</i>” said Bertino, holding up his
plate and looking wise. “Do you think I
am such a fool? I don’t expect to pick
up money; but shall I tell you something?
Well, it is this: In this country I
shall soon make enough money to fill that
valise.”</p>

<p>The others dropped their knives and forks
and regarded him with amazement.</p>

<p>“By the egg of Columbus!” exclaimed
Signor Di Bello. “Are you not to work in
my shop?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; of course.”</p>

<p>“Then how do you expect to make so
much money?”</p>

<p>There was no reason for it; but Bertino,
oddly enough, yielded to a sudden impulse
to repress the truth. Cocking his eye first
to the ceiling and then on the tablecloth, he
uttered a fib that concealed his and Armando’s
darling project for selling life-size busts
in America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>The coffee served and the maraschino
sipped, Signor Di Bello drew the straw
from a Virginia and settled for a smoke,
while Aunt Carolina showed Bertino to
the room in the attic appointed for his
use. She unpacked his few belongings and
placed them tidily in a small chest of drawers,
at the same time laying before him solemnly
the parish-house rules by which she
governed Casa Di Bello. Had her brother
below stairs heard this, it is likely that he
would have sent up many a guffaw with
his smoke rings, for by him these rules had
received little honour save in the steady
nonobservance.</p>

<p>Carolina had never set her face against
Bertino’s coming to the house, and there was
no method in the frosty greeting she had
given him at the door. It was merely that
the sight of him, standing there, bag and
baggage, a whole day before the time, had
staggered her orderly being and drawn from
her an instinctive protest. This all came of
her unruffled years as <i>perpetua</i> of the rectory&mdash;that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
domain of peace and even tenor,
whose broad, clear windows she often regarded
wistfully, looking over the churchyard
to Mott Street, from her sanctum on the
second floor.</p>

<p>A half decade had gone by since the
Wednesday of Ashes when the brother and
sister patched up the quarrel that had separated
them in their poorer days and she
returned to the air of laity. But the sacerdotal
brand would not wear off, nor did she
wish it to. In the conduct of the household
her churchly notions had free scope enough,
but applied in censorship of her brother’s
life they met with dreary contempt. To
no purpose did she preach when Mulberry
buzzed with the latest story of his gallantries,
for his ready argument was always an eloquent
“<i>Ma che!</i>” and an unanswerable
shrug of the shoulders. In vain did she wait
up, often from compline to prime, that she
might shame him when he came home aglow
with bumpers of divers vintage. It was after
a certain rubicund night at the Caffè of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>Three Gardens that he cut short her usual
sermon with a roaring manifesto against
church and state and a declaration of personal
liberty for all time.</p>

<p>“Snakes of purgatory!” he had remarked
in conclusion, one foot on the staircase.
“Am I not a man? If you want priests,
go to the parish house, where you belong.
Once a priest always a priest.”
With this taunt, meant to be a parting
one, he toddled up to bed, but, reaching
the landing, stopped and called back: “If
you don’t leave me alone, I’ll bring a wife
here.”</p>

<p>From that time, which was two years
before Bertino’s arrival, she gave up her nocturnal
vigils, and without let or hindrance
the signore feasted and drank with boon comrades,
and cracked walnuts on his head with
an empty bottle&mdash;a feat for which he was
justly renowned in all the <i>caffès</i> of the quarter.
The lowering peril of a wife in the
house had set her to thinking as she had
never thought before on this dire possibility.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>Her brother’s nonconformity was a flaw in
her sceptre, but she knew that a wife meant
the utter collapse of her sovereignty in Casa
Di Bello. Wherefore she resolved to abide
by the lesser evil, and bend her strength to
warding off the greater. Thus it befell that
with the accession of Bertino to the family
she was not ill content. The coming of a
man to the board imparted no misgiving.
What her soul dreaded and her wits had
guarded against was the advent of a woman.
And she felicitated herself that no wife had
succeeded in crossing the threshold. To her
ever-watchful eye, she fondly believed, was
due the blessing of her brother’s continuance
in the path of bachelorhood, despite the caps
that were set for him on every bush. The
first families of the Calabriani, the Siciliani,
and the Napolitani, along with the flower of
the Genovesi, the Milanesi, and the Torinesi,
had in turn put forth their famous beauties
as candidates for his hand and grocery store.
But they all had been driven from the Rubicon,
and at present there was no pretender
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>in the field. Had there been she would have
known it, as she knew of all the other marital
campaigns, through Angelica, who went
to market daily and kept in touch with Sara
the Frier of Pepper Pods, Mulberry’s queen
of gossips.</p>

<span class="smaller">A SPOT OF YELLOW PAINT</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> morning, while the sun gave its
first touch to the bronze head of Garibaldi,
Bertino tied on an apron and set to work in
Signor Di Bello’s shop, that peerless grocery
whose small window and large door look
tranquilly on the Park of Paradise. For a
dozen years it had been known far and wide
among Italia’s children as “The Sign of the
Wooden Bunch.” The nickname came of a
piece of carved oak simulating a bunch of
bananas that hung before the door. In the
early days of his business life the padrone
had learned that the air of Mulberry was
singularly fatal to the real fruit that he put
on show outside. It happened some days
that as many as twenty bananas on one stem
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>would evaporate, though all the others remained
intact. It was always the ones nearest
the ground that vanished. One evening
it struck Signor Di Bello that a violent
chemical change in the exposed fruit would
put an end to its mysterious disintegration.
So he substituted the bananas of art for
those of Nature. The evaporation ceased
straightway, but for two or three mornings
thereafter certain small boys, on their way
to the Five Points Mission School, beheld
with bitter disappointment the oaken symbol,
and answered its grin of mockery with
looks of blackest disgust.</p>

<p>Those boys are workingmen now, and
when they dream of the springtimes of childhood,
they see Giorgio Di Bello, paint brush
in hand, giving a fresh skin of yellow to the
make-believe bananas. It was a promise of
vernal roses as sure as the chirp of a bluebird
in the churchyard grass or the gladsome
advent of Simone the Sardinian with his
hokey-pokey cart. When the people saw
him giving the bunch its annual sprucing up,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>they were wont to exclaim: “Bravo! Summer
is coming. Soon we shall have music
in Paradise.”</p>

<p>The morning of Bertino’s <i>début</i> at the
shop was a bright one of young June, and
the baby maples of the Park were showing
their first dimples of green. It was the
blatant hour when Mulberry’s street bazaar
is in full cry; when the sham battle fought
every morning between honeyed sellers and
scornful buyers is in hot movement; when
dimes and coppers are the vender’s prize
against flounders, cabbages, saucepans, calicoes,
apples, and shoestrings, as the stake
that fires the housewife’s tongue and eye;
when stout-lunged hucksters cut the din
with the siren songs their kind have sung for
ages in the market place.</p>

<p>Spick and span in the clean blouse of
Monday, Signor Di Bello stood on his broad
threshold ready for the day’s trade. He had
just shown Bertino how to convert the prosy
doorway into a bower abloom with garlands
of freckled <i>salame</i>, cordons of silvery garlic,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>clusters of <i>cacciocavalli</i> cheese; how to hang
in the entry luring sheaves of wild herbs,
strings of hazelnuts, and the golden colocynths
that are&mdash;as all must know&mdash;an anodyne
for every ill. To flaunt this ravishing
group to the senses of the colony was
Bertino’s first duty of the day. That accomplished,
he set out on either side of the
doorway the tubs of tempting stockfish, the
black peas of Lombardy, parched tomatoes
and red peppers, lupini beans in fresh water,
ripe olives in brine, and macaroni of sundry
types.</p>

<p>Presently the foraging women, their blue-and-red-skirted
hips wabbling under the
weight of well-loaded baskets balanced on
their heads, began to enter the shop. Dexterously
taking down their burdens and setting
them on the counter, they called out their
wants in the varied jargons of the Peninsula.
Not only was Signor Di Bello equal to them,
one and all, but he could give back two raps
in the haggling set-to for every tap that he
received. When the morning had worn on,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>and the lay of the last vender had died out,
he opened a small can of yellow paint, chose
a brush from the stock, placed it in the hand
of his nephew, and said:</p>

<p>“<i>Nipote mio</i>, do you see the green spots
on the boughs? Well, it is time to give the
Bunch a new coat.”</p>

<p>Bertino applied the colour, while his
uncle looked on with fond and critical eye,
for it was the first time he had intrusted the
historic task to other hands than his own.
Before the finishing touch had been given he
was called into the shop to hack off a four-cent
chunk of Roman cheese. A moment
later Bertino stepped back to survey his
handiwork, the brush at heedless poise&mdash;Mulberry’s
sidewalks are narrow and teeming&mdash;when
an angry voice fairly stung his
ear:</p>

<p>“<i>Guarda</i>, donkey! What are you
about?”</p>

<p>He turned and looked into the blazing
eyes of a tall young woman, whose full-flowered
beauty startled him more than her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>words had done, and for the moment his
tongue had no speech.</p>

<p>“Clumsy dog! Why don’t you look?”
she began again, drawing out a gingham
handkerchief of purple and putting it to her
face. On her cheek, just where the flush
faded in the rich tawn of her skin, was a spot
of yellow&mdash;as strangely there as though some
fool had tried to adorn a radiant blossom.</p>

<p>“But excuse me; a thousand pardons.
I did not see you,” he blurted. “I did not
see you, <i>veramente</i>, signorina&mdash;beautiful
signorina.”</p>

<p>“Bah!” she flung back. “Where are
your eyes, calf of a countryman?”</p>

<p>He watched her as she sailed away above
the heads of Mulberry’s little brown maids
and matrons, and for hours afterward felt
the spell of her massing black tresses, her
proud step, and the rugged poetry of her
plenteous line.</p>

<p>Small matters these&mdash;a spot of fortuitous
colour, flashing eyes among a people who
are always flashing, and a mountaineer with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>youth in his veins thinking about a well-knit
and warm-hued maid who has proved her
fire with a blistering tongue. But in the
light of all that has come and gone, that
stain of yellow may not be wiped out from
this record of the warring dilemmas that
sharpened the lives of certain little people of
the little world wherein we have set foot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Signor Grabbini</span>, <i>impresario</i> of the
theatre of La Scala, resolved to give up his
valiant but ruinous fight for the legitimate
drama. Such pieces as Othello, Francesca
da Rimini, The Count of Monte Cristo,
acted with a complete cast, had proved a
strain too severe for the treasury as well
as for the capacity of his ten-foot stage.
In scenes where the entire company was
“on,” the jam became so great that spirited
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>pushing set in, each actor aiming to hold
that part of the stage allotted to him by
the playbook. In the struggle, conducted
sometimes with stealthy art, that the audience
might not be aware, toes were trodden
upon and tempers badly stirred. Thus it
happened that after the curtain had rolled
down, the ladies and gentlemen of the company
were likely to fall to shaking their fists
at one another, naturally to the delight of
the audience, who could hear the wordy
battle very distinctly. Wherefore Signor
Grabbini decided to change the policy of his
theatre.</p>

<p>One night he stepped before the curtain
to make the momentous announcement.
Before he could open his mouth a sailor-man,
red as Hiawatha, reached over from
the wicketed parapet of the gallery and
cried:</p>

<p>“A clasp of the hand, comrade!”</p>

<p>With a gallery so low as that it were
folly to court dignity, so the little man
shook the big hand and then began his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>speech, which he punctuated with glances
at a piece of white paper that he held. In
glittering words he set forth the motives
that animated him in deciding upon a
change from the plan of amusement that
had been so successful, so profitable to himself,
and so agreeable to the signori of the
company. But it was because he wished
to serve better, to captivate even more the
highly esteemed, the eminent, the generous
Italian colony, that in the future there
would be no five-act tragedies, but a veritable
banquet every night of short comedies&mdash;oh,
so laughable!&mdash;from the pens of the
world’s greatest dramatists, in the true Italian
as well as the dialect of sweet Naples.</p>

<p>“Bravoes!” from all over the theatre put
a stop to the speech for a moment. Men
in the orchestra pens leaned over the edge
of the stage and lit their cigarettes at the
footlights, and, taking advantage of the
pause, the meal-cake man shouted his wares.</p>

<p>“But this is not all, my friends,” went
on Signor Grabbini.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>A fresh shower of bravoes.</p>

<p>“Keep your feet off my head!” cried a
man in the pit to one in the gallery.</p>

<p>“Bah!” gave back the other, drawing in
a huge boot between the wickets; “in this
theatre one can not stretch his legs.”</p>

<p>“Silence! Hear the <i>impresario</i>!”</p>

<p>“Beginning on Sunday night,” said the
man on the stage, “I shall have the distinct
honour of presenting to the highly discriminating
taste of the most esteemed and eminent
patrons of La Scala an extraordinary
singer of canzonets.”</p>

<p>“Bravo, Signor Grabbini!”</p>

<p>“Silence!”</p>

<p>“Meal cakes! A soldo each!”</p>

<p>“Silence, thou donkey!”</p>

<p>“With your permission, ladies and gentlemen,”
the <i>impresario</i> went on, bowing
low, “I will proceed. The artist to whom
I have referred is&mdash;ah! my friends&mdash;she is
an angel of delight&mdash;a glorious type, a creature
magnificent. My word of honour, the
most beautiful woman in New York&mdash;nay,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>in all America. To the artistic world she is
known as Juno the Superb. Pay strict attention,
my compatriots. The evening of
the Feast of Sunday will indeed be an occasion
most extraordinary, for it is my honoured
privilege to inform you that in addition
to the famous comedies and the
exquisite Juno, there will be an oyster cook
in the audience under the especial administration
of the management, who will prepare
soups of sea fruit in true Neapolitan
style and at prices the most moderate.”</p>

<p>“<i>Bravissimo!</i>”</p>

<p>“Meal&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Silence! <i>Evviva</i> the oyster cook!”</p>

<p>“With these my humble words, highly
prized patrons, I will conclude, and from
the depth of my heart beg you to accept
my most cordial gratitude, and the assurance
that in the future as well as the past you
will find me ever alert to serve faithfully
and to the plenitude of my power the
highly esteemed, the eminent, the generous
Italian colony.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>“Long live the <i>impresario</i>!” was rained
from all parts as he backed off, salaaming.</p>

<p>“<i>Evviva</i> Juno the Superb!” piped one
voice.</p>

<p>“And the oyster soup!” thundered a
Sicilian hod-carrier.</p>

<p>At length the curtain was raised on the
last act of the tragedy, and the knights and
ladies, buffoons and sages, soldiers and huntsmen,
began moving about the stage gingerly,
with great skill avoiding collision as
they crossed or ducking their heads when
they made exits, hurried or slow, through
the dollhouse doors.</p>

<p>On the Feast of Sunday a packed theatre
bore witness to the wisdom of Signor
Grabbini’s change of policy. From the base-board
of the stage, which was fringed by a
row of shrubby black heads, to the last tier
of benches there was no vacant seat. The
first of the short comedies was reeled off
without a single toe trodden on, since it
required only five <i>dramatis personæ</i>. Not
a joke went begging, for the audience heard
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>them all twice&mdash;first from the prompter,
who bawled them from his little green coop
at the footlights, and again from the mouths
of the actors.</p>

<p>Next came the star of the evening, Juno
the Superb. As the orchestra&mdash;blaring its
brass&mdash;struck up the prelude of her song,
Signor Di Bello entered the tiny proscenium
box and dropped into a chair. The fame of
her plethoric beauty had reached him, as the
<i>impresario</i> had taken good care it should
reach many an appreciative masculine ear.
He was a very different-looking man to-night
from the Signor Di Bello of business
hours, clad in a long drab blouse, hacking
Parmesan and weighing macaroni. Now
he showed brave in snowy shirt front of
bulging expanse, large diamond, black coat,
white waistcoat, lavender trousers, and a
gorgeous bouquet stuck under his left
cheek.</p>

<p>When she appeared in the glare of the
lights, draped frankly in the odd colours and
tinsel frippery of the Campania peasant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>maid&mdash;as she is seen nowhere but on the
stage&mdash;it was plain that the <i>impresario</i> had
made an intelligent guess. Her exuberant
charms were sufficient to deal even that
audience a start. The men caught their
breath, and the women made wry faces.
Had they possessed eyes for anything but
Juno, they would have seen that the grocer
in the box was smitten hard by the sudden
picture of billowing womanhood and glowing
flesh tint. “Ah, what beauty!” he
breathed, leaning farther over the rail, deep
in the spell of her great hazel eyes, the
peony of her cheeks, the soft tawn of her
neck, and shoulders that shaded down to
clearest amber. “Pomegranates and hidden
rosebuds! By the egg of Columbus!”</p>

<p>And in truth she was, as every man had
to own, as fine a woman as ever came out of
Italy or any other country. But this did not
keep their teeth off edge when she began to
voice “Santa Lucia,” that evergreen canzonet
of Naples. She pitched upon a key that baffled
the orchestra. The leader stamped his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>foot and shifted tones in vain. Only deaf
ears could have failed to perceive that it was
her generous friend Nature and not art that
had opened to her the stage door.</p>

<p>“Madonna Maria!” was the criticism of
Luigia the Garlic Woman. “She has the
voice of a hungry goat on a foggy morning.”</p>

<p>But there was one pair of eardrums on
which her bleating did not grate. They belonged
to Signor Di Bello, in calmer moments
a man of very good hearing. But he
was stone deaf now. Before the Levantine
charms of this thrilling creature all his senses
were absorbed in sight.</p>

<p>“<i>Brava, bravissima!</i>” he shouted at the
interlude. “<i>Oh, simpiaticone!</i>”</p>

<p>“What a whale she is!” said a phthisic
cigarette girl to her promised husband, who
heard her not.</p>

<p>“An ugly figure she makes, truly,”
sneered a barber’s wife to her husband. “A
big cow like that in the frock of a child!
No honest woman, one sees easily. And
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>look, Adriano! Her nose! I find it similar
to the snout of Signora Grametto’s little
black-faced dog.”</p>

<p>There was no gainsaying this bold touch
of the Supreme Sculptor’s realism. Glorious
her black tresses, delectable her form and
colour, uptilting and ample her nose.</p>

<p>The canzonet ended, she walked off without
bowing to or glancing at the audience,
but the men, one and all, their eye thirst
still unslaked, joined in Signor Di Bello’s
frantic demand for an <i>encore</i>. On she came
with stolid countenance and began the song
all over again, although the women had set
up a hissing that matched the strength of
the applause. Signor Di Bello called the
flower girl into the box, bought an armful
of her wares, and threw them wildly on
the stage. They fell in a shower on all sides
of Juno. Instantly she stopped, put her
arms akimbo, and while the orchestra played
on, glared blackly at her vehement admirer.
Flowers for a Neapolitan of the Porto!
Blossoms that have poison in their breath!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>Stupid Di Bello! Stupid Genovese! Twelve
years in Mulberry, and to forget the hatred
that Neapolitans of Naples have for natural
blooms! Perhaps you thought she was
from the country, like most of the people
there. Bah! In such a serious matter one
ought to be sure.</p>

<p>It was the women’s golden chance. They
started a titter of derisive laughter that became
a gale and swept through the theatre.
Juno moved toward the box, trampling the
odious flowers, and spat in the face of Signor
Di Bello. Then she left the stage, followed
by an outpour of boorish gibes.</p>

<p>“<i>Infame! infame!</i>” It was the voice
of Bertino, crying loudly from the last row
of benches, under the gallery hard by the
door. With a firing emotion that he did
not know was the green fever, he had
watched the doings of his uncle, and when
the bright colours rained about her, brushing
her cheeks and hair, and whisking her shoulders,
he thought with a heart-fall of the
wretched blossom his hand had bestowed a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>week before at the Wooden Bunch. <i>Madre
Santissima!</i> His uncle kissed her with
lovely flowers, and he, miserable soul, kissed
her with a spot of yellow paint. But when
the people laughed and sneered, and he saw
her anger kindle, her cause was his own.
The pigs and sons of pigs! To laugh at
her! At his queen, the <i>amorosa</i> of his
dreamland, by sunglow and starshine, asleep
or at work. Grander than the dames of
Genoa palaces, more beautiful than the
peaches of California. And his uncle! The
old mooncalf! He was the cause of it all.
Served him right that kiss she gave him
back. Ha-ha! But these jeers, these hounds
yelping at his queen! “<i>Infame! infame!</i>”</p>

<p>The people thought he meant it for
Juno, and took up the cry, which did not
subside until the Bay of Naples and the cone
of Vesuvius rolled up from the bottom, and
the second comedy began. Signor Di Bello
had no appetite for this, and he left the box,
passing out amid the nudges and snickers of
the first families of the Genovesi, Milanesi,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>and Torinesi, who were there in force along
with the flower of the Calabriani, Napolitani,
and Siciliani. But he put a good face
on the matter, and at the door hailed the
<i>impresario</i>:</p>

<p>“Ha, Signor Grabbini! Your singer
has at least one liquid tone.” And he disappeared,
chuckling.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE FIRST LADY</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following night, and every night of
the week, Signor Di Bello held forth ecstatically
in the box at La Scala. But the warmth
of his demonstrations for Juno was unable
to melt the frost that her dreadful voice had
caused to settle on the audience&mdash;a frost
that grew thicker with each new display of
her copious self. From his bench under the
gallery Bertino was a witness of his uncle’s
frantic courtship, and the green fever fairly
consumed him, for he had decided that Juno
was made for him, and that neither his uncle
nor any one else should have her for wife.
In the matter of courting he too had not
been idle, though he was young enough to
know better than to make a public show of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>his addresses. More than once it had occurred
that while Signor Di Bello took his
ease in the Caffè of the Three Gardens of an
afternoon, Juno and Bertino passed a quarter
of an hour together in the grocery. With a
black mantilla of cheap lace thrown over her
head, instead of the accustomed shawl that
maids of Mulberry wear on working days,
she visited the shop for her supply of <i>salame</i>,
lupine beans, or the goat’s-milk cheese of
which she told Bertino she was very fond.
The first time she entered, his heart leaped
and he began stammering excuses for the
spot of yellow he had given her cheek at
their last meeting. Would the beautiful
signorina believe that it was all an accident,
clumsy calf that he was&mdash;a mishap most
stupid? He begged her to forgive him.
Would she not? Oh, how happy it would
make him!</p>

<p>“Bah!” she answered, looking him over.
“Give me good weight of <i>salame</i> and free
measure of beans.”</p>

<p>Clearly, the weight and measure that he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>gave suited her, for she came every afternoon
thereafter, but never when Signor Di
Bello happened to be in the shop. One day
he said to her:</p>

<p>“Every night I dream of you.”</p>

<p>“Ah, <i>si</i>?” she replied, arching her rich
brows. “And every night I dream. Shall
I tell you of what?”</p>

<p>“Of me?” breathed Bertino.</p>

<p>“Of you? Simpleton! I dream of getting
out of this hogpen. Blood of San Gennaro!
Do you think I came to America
to live a life like this? Wait until I have
money in the Bank of Risparmio.”</p>

<p>“But, signorina, I love you.”</p>

<p>“Love! What good is that? It may
do for these animals to live on. For me,
no. When I marry I shall become a grand
signora.”</p>

<p>On the fifth day of their acquaintance
she told him her troubles. Five dollars a
week was all she got at La Scala, and Signor
Grabbini&mdash;a man most stingy&mdash;kept
back two of that for the dress, the scarlet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>slippers, and the pink tights. Don’t talk to
her of America as a place to make money.
What a pigsty was Mulberry! Her room,
which she hired of Luigia the Garlic Woman,
was smaller and darker than any she ever
had in Naples. And what did it cost? A
whole dollar every week! Five <i>liras</i> for a
room! Merciful Madonna!</p>

<p>“Listen,” said Bertino, coming from behind
the counter and walking with her to
the door; “I want you for my wife. Marry
me, and you shall live in the finest house in
Mulberry&mdash;in Casa Di Bello.”</p>

<p>“What have you to do with that house?”
she asked quickly.</p>

<p>“I live there.”</p>

<p>“But it belongs to Signor Di Bello.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I am his nephew.”</p>

<p>A new interest awoke in her wary and
artful eye. “They say he is very rich,” she
mused, looking toward the patch of green in
Paradise. “He admires my singing very
much.”</p>

<p>“Your singing! Bah!” Bertino’s love
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>was not deaf. “Don’t you know why he
makes a baboon of himself when you are on
the stage? You have turned his old head
with your beauty.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you,” she said absently,
while there came into her mind an extravagant
avowal of love that Signor Di Bello
had made to her behind the scenes the night
before. “Well, he is rich,” she went on,
“and you&mdash;are poor.”</p>

<p>“True; I am not rich now, but I shall
be soon. Ha! Do you know how I am
going to make money? I do not tell everybody&mdash;not
even my uncle&mdash;but I will tell
you. I have a friend in Italy, at Cardinali.
Do you know the place? No matter. My
friend is what is called a sculptor, and he is
going to make statues&mdash;oh, so fine!&mdash;of
great people in this country. Now, it is I
who am to tell him what to make. When
I have made up my mind, I shall send him
the picture of some great American&mdash;some
famous man&mdash;and from this he will make a
marble bust. The marble is all ready.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>When it is done he will send it to me, and
I shall&mdash;well, perhaps I shall put it in some
fine gallery like our Palazzo Rosso in Genoa.
Ah, what a place that is! I was there once
on the Feast of the Child. Now, my friend
is a sculptor most wonderful. I know what
he can do. You should see his beautiful
Juno and the Peacock. If you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Juno and the Peacock?” she broke in.
“What is that?”</p>

<p>“Ah! a lady most beautiful, without
any clothes, and a great bird with a long
tail. Oh, how beautiful&mdash;as beautiful as
you!”</p>

<p>“<i>Veramente?</i>”</p>

<p>“I tell you the truth. Now, when the
people of America see the bust that he shall
send, what do you think they will do? Why,
they will be mad for it, and some rich man
will buy it. I have not yet made up my
mind how much I shall make him pay. Not
less than a thousand <i>liras</i>, of that you may
be sure. But this will be only the beginning.
After that Armando will make more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>busts, the rich ladies and gentlemen will
continue to buy, and&mdash;who knows?&mdash;Bertino
Manconi may become a millionaire.
<i>Now</i> will you be my wife?”</p>

<p>“He has made one Juno,” she said, her
thought set on a single phase of his chimera&mdash;that
whomever he chose for the subject,
after that person a bust would be fashioned.
“Since he has made one Juno, why not let
him make another?” She said it seriously,
without guile. “Oh, so many photographs
I had taken in Naples! Here, none; I am
too poor. Next week I shall have some.
But how fine I should look in marble! I
have thought of it many a time. Ah, <i>proprio
bella, neh</i>?”</p>

<p>“You would make the finest bust in the
world,” he said ardently.</p>

<p>“I think so myself,” she nodded, drawing
the mantilla under her chin and moving
away with her package of freely weighed
codfish. He watched her until she turned
into the mouth of the Alley of the Moon,
whereon her lodgings looked, and the idea
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>that she had put into his head took deeper
hold.</p>

<p>“Why not?” he asked the tub of olives
at the door. “Is there a more beautiful
woman in America? It is settled. To-morrow
I shall say to her, ‘<i>Carissima</i> Juno,
when you are my wife I will send your picture
to Armando, that you may be the first
bust.’”</p>

<p>He stood in the doorway gazing out on
the park, assured now that she must be his&mdash;for
what greater honour could man show
to woman?&mdash;when his eye met the bronze
presence of Italy’s liberator. A withered
wreath of laurel, with which the Italian
societies had crowned their hero on his last
birthday, had dropped over the head and
become a lopsided necklace. Bertino saw
the half-drawn sword, the bared arm, the
conquering air, and his promise to Armando
came back:</p>

<p>“It shall be some one as great as Garibaldi.”</p>

<p>Thus it fell out that the following afternoon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
when Juno came to the shop for
garlic and spaghetti, and told him that of
all things she would like to see herself in
marble, he said: “No; it would be false to
my friend.”</p>

<p>“And you say you dream of me?”</p>

<p>“By night and by day.”</p>

<p>“And you love me?”</p>

<p>“Ah, <i>si</i>; Madonna knows.”</p>

<p>“Still you will not do me this favour?”</p>

<p>“But it is to be the bust of a man.”</p>

<p>“Bah! Why not a woman?”</p>

<p>“No, no; I can not. It would be
treachery to Armando.”</p>

<p>None the less, she had spoken the words
that sealed the fate of the bust. “Why not
a woman, indeed?” Bertino asked himself
when she had gone. “But it must be the
greatest as well as the handsomest woman
in America.” He thought of the picture of
the President’s wife that he had seen one
night at an illustrated Italian lecture in the
Hudson Mission. “By San Giorgio!” he
exclaimed, astonished at the grandeur of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>own idea. “A bust of her Majesty, the
First Lady of America! This is the best
thing I ever thought of.”</p>

<p>The next day was one of vast import.
Not only did it witness the purchase by
Bertino in a Bowery store of a small photograph
of the President’s wife, warranted
genuine, but it brought to the ears of Aunt
Carolina news that made her tremble for
Casa Di Bello. From the market place Angelica
bore the gossip that was fast reaching
every niche and turn of Mulberry&mdash;the great
tidings that Signor Di Bello and Juno the
Superb had been seen the night before in
the Caffè of the Beautiful Sicilian sitting
at the same table eating a ragout of spiced
pigskin.</p>

<p>“It must be stopped!” declared Carolina,
setting her gold-patched teeth. The
old bugaboo of a wife arose, as it did with
any woman to whom the running voice of
the colony linked her brother’s name. “He
shall never bring that Neapolitan baggage
to Casa Di Bello.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>That night, after dinner, from which her
brother was absent, she hung long gold pendants
in her ears, fastened her lace collar with
a large cameo brooch, and, her puce-coloured
silk all arustle, went to reconnoitre, as she
always did when the sky of her dominion
was threatened with a wife. It was a rare
sight to see Signorina Di Bello abroad at
night, afoot in the heart of Mulberry, and
people stared in wonder or bowed reverently
as she passed by. A half-hour afterward,
when the Bay of Naples and smoking Vesuvius
made way for Juno on the stage of La
Scala, three shoots of the Di Bello stock
were intent beholders&mdash;Giorgio in the box,
Bertino on his bench under the gallery, and
Carolina in a seat directly overhead, where
her brother could not see her. With ears
stopped, but eyes wide open, the priestly
dame surveyed with alarm the expansive glories
of Juno, and regarded with dismay the
rhapsody of Signor Di Bello. If she knew
her brother, and she was confident that she
did, here was a woman who could have him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>for a husband. Thoughtfully she walked
home, and thoughtfully she sought her pillow.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From the land of sleep there came no
helpful message, and in the morning she sat
before her sanctum window still pondering
what to do. Over the forest of gray shafts
that marked the sepulchres in St. Patrick’s
Churchyard she gazed sadly at the broad
windows of the rectory where she had lived
those years of sweetest order and tranquility,
where husbands and wives had no part
in life’s economy, where marrying woman
and wedlocking man jarred not the placid
liturgy of her days. Suddenly the door
swung wide, and Angelica panted into the
room. As fast as her short legs could waddle
she had come from the market place with
a basket full of fresh vegetables and a head
full of dewy scandal.</p>

<p>“O signorina! The shame!” she gasped.
“Truly a disgrace tremendous! Mulberry
talks of naught else. I speak of what I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>know, for it comes straight from the lips of
Sara the Frier of Pepper Pods, who had it
first from Simone the Snail Boiler.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“A grand shame! Signor Di Bello is
betrothed to the Neapolitan singer!”</p>

<p>“Juno the Superb?”</p>

<p>“<i>Si, signorina.</i> Oh, the disgrace!”</p>

<p>“<i>Misericordia, Santa Maria!</i>”</p>

<p>“And the day is set. Luigia the Garlic
Vender says it, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“For when?”</p>

<p>“The Feast of Januarius.”</p>

<p>“The baggage!” said Carolina, her austere
calm all gone. “That’s her doing. A
Genovese to be married on the Feast of St.
Januarius! By the mass, we shall see!”</p>

<p>Even as the bottled blood of Naples’s
patron saint boils once a year, so did the
corked emotions of Carolina begin to bubble.
Clearly the hour for action had come.
It was not the first time that a war cloud of
matrimony had darkened her sky, and she
buckled for the onset with a veteran heart.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>She plumed herself on having outwitted and
driven to retreat more than a dozen pretenders
to her brother’s hand. Once it was the
daughter of Pescoli the Undertaker, a ripe
maid of barn-owl face and sinewy pattern,
famed for settling disputes with the neighbours
<i>pugnis et calcibus</i>; but Carolina pitted
brain against brawn, and this terror bit the
dust. Next came the red Milanese, widow
of Baroni the merchant in secondhand bread.
In her hand she brought her husband’s ten
years’ savings for dowry, and on her apricot
face, still fresh, her everblooming smile;
she, too, was outgeneralled by Carolina, as
were many other would-be wives as fast as
they showed their heads. At least, so it
seemed to Carolina. That she held her place
as mistress of Casa Di Bello, she firmly believed,
was due solely to the fact of her
never-flagging vigilance. But it may be
guessed that her brother’s side of the story
would have dimmed her self-glory as a match-breaker.
Once he said to her, spicing the
sentiment with a dry laugh:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>“Do you think I can’t admire a fine
woman without giving her a wedding ring?”</p>

<p>But from the watchtower of her ever-present
dread the petticoats that she espied
were always signals of real danger, however
he might laugh them to false alarms. Wherefore
she felt that she must take up the
cudgels against Juno as she had raised them
against other women, and that without delay.
The teeming line and colour of the
Neapolitan were clear in her memory, and she
knew a stronger siege than ever had been
laid to her brother’s taste. Henceforth eternal
alertness would be the price of Signor
Di Bello’s bachelorhood and her own reign,
which she took as a most serious matter.
Alas! it was the same old battle. Would
the struggle never end? And this ever-returning
necessity of standing watch and
ward, of fighting away aspirants for wedding
rings, rose before her now in an unwonted
light, as a penance that ought not to be laid
upon her, as one that she would like to put
off. She could see herself all her days beating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
back would-be wives from the portals of
Casa Di Bello, and the troubled outlook
weighted her spirit with despair. A yearning
for peace entered her soul, and with it came
the thought of a startling alternative for war&mdash;a
voice telling her to do the very thing
that she had fought so long against her
brother’s doing. Take a wife! But her
taking a wife, she mused smugly, should be
quite a different matter from his taking one.
The maid of her choosing would be no menace
to the <i>status quo</i> of Casa Di Bello. She
would be a person of right notions, not
puffed with the foolish conceit of being able
to govern the household; a <i>ragazza</i> with
good sense enough to see that a wife’s place
under the connubial roof is far inferior to that
of her husband’s sister. Ah! the wife of her
choice, she told herself fondly, should be
her creature, not a ruler; a subject, not a
trampler, of her parish-house laws. It never
struck Carolina’s mind to seek her ideal
among the girls of New Italy; that would
be calling for aid to the camp of the enemy.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>Her fancy took wing over seas to old Italy,
to Apennine maids untinged of the craft and
airs of Mulberry; to some maid of clay that
would shape easy in the mould of her wish.
When Bertino came in at noon from the
shop, she began:</p>

<p>“You have a sister?”</p>

<p>“<i>Si</i>; Marianna.”</p>

<p>“Very well. What kind of a girl is
she?”</p>

<p>“A fine girl.”</p>

<p>“Is she sound in health?”</p>

<p>“Ah, <i>si</i>; very sound.”</p>

<p>“How big is she?”</p>

<p>“Medium size.”</p>

<p>“Gentle and kind?”</p>

<p>“Yes, very gentle.”</p>

<p>“How old?”</p>

<p>“Let me think. She will be seventeen
come the Feast of the Mother.”</p>

<p>“Any bad traits?”</p>

<p>“Not a single one, except that she eats
too much molasses.”</p>

<p>“What work does she?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>“Straw-plaiting.”</p>

<p>“Do you think she would like to come
to America?”</p>

<p>“Not unless&mdash;unless&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Not unless Armando came.”</p>

<p>“Armando? An <i>amante</i>, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes, aunt; her <i>amante</i>.”</p>

<p>“Bah!” Her spinster mind did not count
this a serious matter. “Perhaps I shall send
for her.”</p>

<p>“She wouldn’t leave Armando.”</p>

<p>“Then I might go and bring her.”</p>

<p>“What do you want of her?” ventured
Bertino.</p>

<p>“Some day you shall see.”</p>

<span class="smaller">CAROLINA RESOLVES TO GO COURTING</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Upon</span> the facts brought out Carolina
decided that Marianna would do very well.
But the leap was far too hazardous to be
taken in the dark, and the prudence that
guided her in the selection of other household
belongings she would now bring to
bear in choosing a wife. If needs be, she
would journey to Italy, and make sure by a
close survey of Marianna that hers was not
a nature likely to attempt a ruling of the
roost. To the Jesuitry of her view, a wife of
eighteen and a husband of gloaming forty
were well mated when their union would
serve her own most laudable purpose; and
as for any trifling obstacle like a sweetheart,
that could be filliped away. Once upon the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>ground, and satisfied that the girl would
prove a wife of the desired brand, she had
no doubt of accomplishing the shipment of
the goods. But there set in a fear for the
turn events might take during her absence.
With the sentinel gone from the gate, Juno
might charge and carry the castle. Here
was a danger that must be offset.</p>

<p>Throwing a plaid shawl over her head
and not stopping to change her open-heeled
house slippers, she set forth through the ruck
of Mulberry for the shop of her brother. It
was a novel sight to behold her hopping
over curbstones in that unstately manner,
and hot grew the scandalous guesses as to
the cause.</p>

<p>“Trouble, grand trouble in Casa Di
Bello,” was the common voice.</p>

<p>As Carolina hurried forward she had no
eye for the signs of opening summer on
every hand&mdash;the fire escapes abloom with
potted verdure, the blithe touch that glistening
radishes gave to the vegetable stalls, the
moon face of Chiara the Basilican beaming
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>from her bower of dandelion leaves. Passing
the schoolhouse, she received a reverent
bow and a low “<i>Buon giorno</i>” from the
hokey-pokey man, who stood by his dazzling
cart, ready for the onslaught of boys and
girls, who would soon be out at recess clamouring
for one-cent dabs of pink <i>sorbetto</i>
on strips of brown paper. Little maidens
decked in snowy frocks and veils walked
proudly to their first communion, all mindful
of their skirts as they passed the racks
of Boccanegra the Macaroni Baker, whose
new-made paste hung drying in the sunshine;
but of them Carolina took no heed,
so wrapped was she in her great project of
courting a suitable wife.</p>

<p>At Bayard Street the sound of voices
raised in a familiar anthem caught her ear,
and there swung into view from around the
corner a handful of marching men. They
were members of the Genovese Society,
garbed bravely in the uniform of Italian
infantry, out to celebrate the Feast of St.
George, of all holidays the dearest to Genoa.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>At sight of them the cloud of anxiety that
had shadowed her face lifted, and she smiled
with a shrewd content. The Feast of San
Giorgio! Her brother’s birthday as well as
the day of the knight who carved the dragon.
The alarm sounded by Angelica concerning
Juno had driven the fact from her head, but
there came back with it now a heartsome
consciousness that it was a day of rockribbed
truth in her brother’s life. If at other times
his promises might have the frailty of spaghetti
sticks, she knew that it would not be
so on this, his saint’s day. It had ever been
so with the men of Genoa. With renewed
spirits she foresaw the success of her plan to
exact from him a pledge not to marry until
she should return from Italy. Such a promise
or any other made to-day he would
keep, though all the maids and widows of
Mulberry united to make him disregard it.</p>

<p>She found him alone at the shop, sprawled
outside beneath the Wooden Bunch in his
curve-backed chair, bathing in the sunshine.
Only on rare and critical occasions did she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>visit the shop, and the sight of her brought
him quickly to his feet.</p>

<p>“<i>Governo ladro!</i>” he exclaimed. “What
has happened?”</p>

<p>“I am going to Italy.”</p>

<p>“To Italy! What for?”</p>

<p>“It is twelve years since I heard the
chimes of San Lorenzo.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I think so,” he said, going behind
the counter, shaving off a piece of Roman
cheese and tossing it into his mouth. “When
do you set off?”</p>

<p>“As soon as possible.”</p>

<p>“There is a ship for Genoa to-morrow,”
he said eagerly.</p>

<p>Looking him in the eye, she asked, “Are
you betrothed to the Napolitana?”</p>

<p>“Satan the crocodile!” he roared, pounding
the counter. “This is too much! Do
you count me a simpleton?”</p>

<p>“Promise me, <i>caro fratello</i>, that you will
not take a wife until I return.”</p>

<p>“By the Egg, I will not promise! Do
you think I don’t know this is my birthday?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>Suppose the ship went down? I should
have to live and die a bachelor.”</p>

<p>“Promise at least that you will marry no
one for three months.”</p>

<p>“<i>Ma che?</i> What nonsense is this? Are
you afraid of the Napolitana? Bah! How
foolish you are! A fine woman, yes. But
do you think I don’t know what I am about?”</p>

<p>“Promise for three months.”</p>

<p>“<i>Si, si</i>, if you wish it; but it is all grand
nonsense.”</p>

<p>“Do you know what I am going to do in
Italy?” she asked, with an essay at archness
that was a sorry failure.</p>

<p>“Hunt a husband?” he chuckled.</p>

<p>“No; a wife.”</p>

<p>“What shall you do with her?” he asked
gravely, scenting the truth.</p>

<p>“Bring her to you, my brother.”</p>

<p>“To me! Excuse me; keep her for
yourself. That is an affair I shall attend to
when the time comes.”</p>

<p>“But in Mulberry you can not get what
I shall bring you from Italy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“A wife that is good enough for you
and Casa Di Bello.”</p>

<p>“Bah! What do you tell me?” he
growled walking to the door. “Talk to
me about wives! They are as thick as the
sparrows in Paradise, and just as hungry.
Good, fine wives, too.” He dropped into
the chair, thrust his hands into his pockets,
and extended his little legs. “Who is she?”
he asked after a while, twirling his huge
mustache.</p>

<p>“Marianna. Don’t you remember her?
Bertino’s foster sister. A fine young girl;
no bad habits and sound in health.”</p>

<p>“What age?”</p>

<p>“Eighteen.”</p>

<p>“You’d better buy your passage ticket,”
he said, “if you wish to go on to-morrow’s
ship.”</p>

<span class="smaller">A FLUTTER IN THE TOMATO BANK</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> a step almost frisky Carolina took
leave of her brother, well content with the
first fruit of her wooing. She had won the
consent of her husband elect to wait for her
bride, and the rest of the courtship seemed
a matter of plain sailing; wherefore she
hastened across the Park to the steamship
office and bank of Signor Tomato to secure
her passage for Genoa. The glow of triumph
was upon her. She felt it a certainty
now that her will would prevail in match-making
as it had so many times in match-breaking;
and this desirable condition, she
reflected, was merely as it should be&mdash;only
the reward that the just had a right to
count upon receiving. Had she not eaten
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>salted fish in Lent and kept all fast days,
while her brother had devoured flesh in
open shame and Angelica had been detected
munching garlic <i>salame</i> even on Good
Friday?</p>

<p>She paused before the mutilated but heroic
figure of an American Jack Tar who
stood in wooden repose at the door of Signor
Tomato. In their palmy days the banks of
Mulberry&mdash;then more numerous than the
colony’s midwives&mdash;had a trick of closing
their doors when the amount of deposits
made it worth while, to the increase of the
suicide rate and the encouragement of stiletto
practice upon the bankers who got
caught. After a while the Legislature did a
little closing, and Signor Tomato, one of the
poor but honest caste, had to take his gruel
along with the others. He could not take
any more deposits, but he kept on with his
money-exchange business, and when to this
he decided to add an agency for Mediterranean
steamships he admitted the Jack Tar
as a silent partner. At the time they joined
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>forces the sailor was young and handsome.
The tobacconist with whom he began his
career had failed after less than a year of ill
fortune. But his youth and hardy physique
were no match for the climate of Mulberry,
which soon proved as ruinous to his manly
beauty as it had to Signor Di Bello’s real
bananas. First one of his weather eyes disappeared,
then the fine Greek nose took
leave, and in quick order both ears vanished;
at length an arm and a half melted away,
soon followed by a whole foot. It all came
of his lounging on the sidewalk at hours
when not even a respectable wooden Indian
is found out of doors. Signor Tomato
would have insisted on his coming in of
nights, but there was not an inch of room
to spare within the bank, with his wife and
three little Tomatoes all living there, not to
speak of the counter, the large dry-goods
box that served for a safe, the family chair,
and the cook stove. Once he wheeled his
silent partner into the countingroom&mdash;just
after the loss of his left ear&mdash;but the door
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>could not be closed, and out he had to go
again into the ravaging night.</p>

<p>It was not the long-suffering Jack Tar
that arrested Carolina’s steps, but this placard
pendent from his neck:</p>

<p class="box center no-indent">
Per Genova Juno 1,<br />
Piroscafo Spartan King,<br />
Qui si Vendono Biglietti di<br />
Passaggio a Prezzi d’Occasione.</p>

<p>(For Genoa June 1, the Spartan King.
Passage Tickets for sale here at Bargain
Prices.)</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Signorina Di Bello!
You do me great honour to read my poor
placard.” It was the high-keyed voice of
Signor Tomato, a little Neapolitan of eagle
beak and long brown whiskers. As he
stepped lightly from the bank, Bridget, his
stout Irish wife, was behind him. She, too,
gave Carolina a loud greeting, but in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>brogue that was touched with Neapolitan
dialect, and took up her stand in the narrow
doorway. At the same time three black,
curly heads and bright faces peeped from
behind her gingham skirts. These intent
observers were Pat, Mike, and Biddy, small
but weighty factors of the Tomato establishment.
At the sound of her husband’s voice
the mother and her brood had come from a
mysterious corner at the back of the bank,
which a nankeen sail concealed from the eye.
Carolina gave cold return to Signor Tomato’s
salute, but his face did not fall. “Perhaps
the signorina is planning a voyage?”
he said, smiling broadly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I go to Genoa. What company
is this?”</p>

<p>“What company!” he exclaimed, his
face an image of deepest amazement. “But
pardon me, signorina; there is only one
company in the Mediterranean service, the
Great Imperial International General Navigation
Company, which I have the honour
to represent.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p>“Father Nicodemo went last week on
some other line&mdash;the Duke? That’s it&mdash;the
Duke Line.”</p>

<p>“O signorina!” All his faculties of expression
united in a show of disgust. “You
remember the proverb, ‘Do what the priest
says and not what the priest does.’ My word
of honour, those Duke boats, they are for
the beasts. But the Great Imperial International
General Navigation Company’s
ships are extraordinary, stupendous! Every
one is a floating paradise. Shall I speak
frankly and tell you what they are? Well,
they are boats for ladies and gentlemen.
There now, you have it.”</p>

<p>“Arrah, <i>si</i>; for signorinies like yersilf
and signories, sure.” In business matters
Bridget always aided her husband with a
corroborant note.</p>

<p>“Do you know what happened to a
friend of mine who went on that other
line?” the banker continued. “He caught
the grip. Why? Now, signorina, your
attention, and I will tell you. The Duke
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>Line is not Italian, eh? Well, what kind
of food do you suppose he got from those
Englishmen? Bifsoup, bifsoup, bifsoup;
rosbif, rosbif, rosbif. And not a grain of
cheese for the soup! For eighteen days he
saw macaroni only once, and then it was
cooked without oil and had not even the
tail of an anchovy or a piece of kidney to
flavour it. For eighteen long days he had
not so much as a smell of garlic or the sight
of a pepper pod. Do you wonder that he
caught the grip?”</p>

<p>Carolina was impressed, and Bridget
clinched the argument with “Arrah, divvil
a wonder!”</p>

<p>“Besides,” Signor Tomato went on, “that
line is what we navigators call uncertain, lame
ships. The signorina will recall the proverb,
‘If you go with the lame you learn to limp.’”</p>

<p>“I wish to sail to-morrow. Give me a
second-class ticket.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow! Boiling blood of San
Gennaro! But I will do it, signorina; I
will get the ticket.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>Instantly Banca Tomato became a scene
of bustle and excitement. The padrone
sprang for the door, pushing aside Bridget
and scattering her brood. He darted behind
the curtain and reappeared in a second with
his coat and hat.</p>

<p>“In ten minutes you shall know,” he
said, making off in the direction of Broadway,
where there was a real agency of the
line.</p>

<p>“Will ye sit down?” said Bridget, placing
the family chair near Carolina, at the
foot of the Jack Tar. “Wisha! Black
toimes it is for bankers, and no babies
comin’ to kape the wolf from the dure. It’s
mesilf that remimbers this day four years
come Patrick’s mornin’ when me Biddy first
saw the light. Arrah, manny’s the family
wanted me thin for a wet nurse, and a fine
pinny had they to pay, thim that got Bridget
Tomah-toe. Thin it was meat in the
soup ivry day. And now phat is it? Cabbage
in a sup iv water, and secondhand cabbage,
too, manny’s the toime. But I’m
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>after raisin’ the little darlints as good as anny
in Mulberry, and much better, should anny
wan ax ye.”</p>

<p>“Who ask-a me? I’m know northeen
’bout dat,” said Carolina, whose English
scholarship had few equals in the colony.</p>

<p>“Iv coorse ye don’t. Sure the signorinies
are not expected to, and they be ould
enough to vote ivry hour on ’lection day.
It’s lucky y’are to be goin’ back to the ould
country. How long is it y’re out?”</p>

<p>“Ees twelf year dat I’m in deesa countree.”</p>

<p>“Twelve years! Howly Mother! And
ye’re not married yet! Troth I was Signory
Tomah-toe the first year I landed.”</p>

<p>“What I’m care?” retorted Carolina.
“You mague too moocha noise from de
mout. Ees better you goin’ keep-a still.”</p>

<p>Luckily for the cash interests of the
bank, Signor Tomato appeared at this point,
for Bridget was not a woman to adopt any
one’s suggestion that she hold her tongue.
Carolina got her steamship ticket, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>banker pocketed the first commission he
had received in a week.</p>

<p>There was meat in the Tomato soup that
night, and on the way from the butcher’s
Bridget, with Pat, Mike, and Biddy at her
apron hem, stopped in the Caffè of the
Beautiful Sicilian and bought each of them
a green cake out of the chromatic display in
the window. While the youngsters were
all eyes and hands for the pastry, Bridget
was all sight and mind for a certain living
picture that she beheld in the half gloom of
the <i>caffè’s</i> innermost depth. Seated at a
table were Bertino and Juno the Superb.
She was tipping pensively a glass of red
wine, and he, with paper and ink before
him, writhed in the throes of pen-wielding.</p>

<p>“Ho, ho, me beauty!” said Bridget to
herself on the way home. “I’m thinkin’
the ould wan ud have a worrud to say about
that. So the nephew is afther her along
wid the uncle, and she afther both fish wid
the wan hook. Well, I hope the gossoon
gets her, and it’ll do him anny good. Di
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>Belly ought to be cut out, the ould divvil,
wid his winkin’ and blinkin’ and collyfoxin’
afther young gerruls. But it’s noane iv my
potaties, and I’ll not disgrace mesilf talkin’
iv it. If who’s-this&mdash;Sara the Pepper Pod&mdash;iver
got hold iv it though, wouldn’t there
be a whillihu in Mulberry! Thim ghinny
wimmin do be good for nothin’ but makin’
trouble wid their tongues. And phat am I
sayin’, annyway? Talkin’ iv the ghinnies!
Faith I’m half ghinny mesilf.” When she
reached the bank she said to Signor Tomato,
“There’s trouble brewin’ in the Di
Belly family.”</p>

<p>“Troub in de fam! Ees what for?”
He took an ancient black pipe from his
mouth and stood up, all attention. She
told him what she had seen in the gloom of
the <i>caffè</i>. “Ha, ha!” he cried, placing a
forefinger wisely beside his nose, as he
always did when quoting his Neapolitan
saws, “the mouse dances a <i>tarantella</i> when
the cat takes a <i>siesta</i>.”</p>

<p>“True for ye, Dominick; and a jewel
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>iv a dance ’twill be agin the ould maid’s
comin’ from Italy. Bad ’cess to her annyhow,
and may the divvil fly away wid her
back hair! Tellin’ me to hould me tongue!”</p>

<p>When the boiling pot had filled the bank
with its savour, she went to the door and
looked with pride on her raven-curled trio
in the roadway playing “duck on a tomato
can.”</p>

<p>“Here, Pat, Mike, Biddy!” she called.
“Come in and ate your soup.”</p>

<p>They romped in, playing tag on the
way.</p>

<span class="smaller">JUNO PERFORMS A MIRACLE</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> great import was the picture Bridget
saw in the Caffè of the Beautiful Sicilian.
It was Bertino’s afternoon off from the
shop, and he had planned the meeting with
Juno the preceding day while his uncle
fought again the battles of Garibaldi before
an audience of admiring comrades at the
Three Gardens. The little <i>tête-à-tête</i> meant
that a crisis had suddenly developed in the
green fever of the grocery clerk. His temperature
had reached a degree where he
swore <i>vendetta</i>. Yes, to-day she must
choose between life with him and death
with his rival. It all came of the Snail
Boiler’s false report that Signor Di Bello
had betrothed himself to the Superb. But
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>Juno eased matters by coming to the tryst
with consent on her lips. She would be his
wife. It was not Bertino’s hot breathings
of revenge, however, that had melted the
handsome iceberg. Her change of poise
was due to a pair of hard knocks that life
had playfully dealt her the night before.
The first came from the <i>impresario</i>, who
told her, with tearful voice, that the affairs
of the theatre had gone so badly of late that
he was obliged&mdash;how much against his will
Iddio knew&mdash;to dispense with her services.
The second blow came after the performance,
when she was eating <i>polenta</i> and birds
with Signor Di Bello. She had broached
the subject of a wedding ring, only to have
him dash her hopes with a roar of laughter
that shook the <i>caffè</i>. The rich husband
failing and her stage career closed, she decided
to tide over present difficulties by accepting
Bertino’s offer of a situation as wife.
Though he had promised her a home in
Casa Di Bello, she was too shrewd not to
perceive that he would find it a promise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>hard to make good. But there was another
prize whereon she had set her purpose.</p>

<p>She was madly addicted to the photograph
habit. The only genuine emotion of
which her nature seemed capable was the
one of delight she evinced when beholding
a picture of herself in some new pose. In
Naples a good part of her earnings as bottle-washer
in a wine house had gone for portraits;
and the passion still clinging to her,
she had begun to mortgage her salary at the
theatre to a Mulberry photographer. In
two days she had posed three times, and
brought each set of the tintypes to the grocery
to show them to Bertino. At sight of
them he rolled his eyes, clasped his hands,
and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Ah, how beautiful! How sympathetic!”</p>

<p>“It would make a fine bust, <i>neh</i>?” she
would add, but to this Bertino always returned
a decisive no. Once she showed him
an old solar print that was taken in Naples.
It portrayed her in bare shoulders, with a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>lace mantle over her head and eyes looking
soulfully at the moon. This was her favourite.
“In America,” she declared, “they
could not make a <i>ritratto</i> like that.” But
with all her pictures there remained a gnawing
in the stomach of her vanity&mdash;a hunger
that would not be allayed since the moment
that he told her about the bust. She
wanted to see herself in marble.</p>

<p>It was understood between them that at
the meeting this afternoon they would settle
the marriage question once and for all; Bertino
told himself it would be settled for life
or death. On his way to the <i>caffè</i> he encountered
Carolina, and she stunned him
with the news of her coming departure for
Italy.</p>

<p>“To-night I go aboard,” she said.
“Thus I shall not miss the ship and have
to wait five weeks for another, as Father
Nicodemo did.”</p>

<p>With thrift-prodding anxiety Bertino
walked on, thinking out a plan for turning
her voyage to the advantage of himself and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>Armando. The letter he meant to write,
and its inclosure of a portrait of the President’s
wife, had assumed in his mind a
boundless importance. It would be a
packet far too valuable for intrustment to
the ordinary mail, and registering letters to
Europe he had found, on inquiry of Banker
Tomato, to be a costly business; nor was it
any too safe, according to the same authority.
Aunt Carolina was going to Cardinali;
why not send it by her? With her own
hands she could deliver the precious missive
to Armando. Nothing could be safer or
cheaper. But there was not a moment to
lose if she went aboard to-night.</p>

<p>Thus it had come about that when Juno
entered the <i>caffè</i> she found Bertino writhing
in the travail of chirography. Before him
on the table lay a photograph of the First
Lady of the Land. She checked an impulse
to catch it up and tear it to shreds.</p>

<p>Taking a chair by the table she watched
him while he wrote. When he had finished
the letter he read it over slowly, then took
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>up the picture of the President’s wife to fold
the written sheet around it and place it in
the envelope.</p>

<p>“Bah!” she said. “You talk of love.
What love! Why don’t you send this picture
for the bust instead of that one? Am
I not more beautiful?” She drew from her
skirt pocket her favourite portrait&mdash;the one
that showed her gazing wistfully at the moon.</p>

<p>“Anything but that,” he answered.
“The next one shall be yours. I swear it,
if you will swear to be my wife. Ah, <i>mia
preziosa</i>, in this letter there is a fortune for
me&mdash;for us both. Don’t you see the fine
idea it is to have a bust made of such a grand
signora? It will make a <i>furore tremendo</i> in
America.”</p>

<p>He had put the letter and the picture in
the envelope, and in another instant would
have sealed it, but Juno sprang to her feet
and pointed to the door, crying:</p>

<p>“Quick! Go stop him! That man with
the brown hat&mdash;my cousin! He has just
passed. I must see him. Quick, Bertino!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>He started for the door, but hardly
had he reached it before she snatched the
envelope from the table, took out the
photograph of the President’s wife and
put in the one of herself. Bertino ran
back and forth in search of the myth with
the brown hat, and at length returned,
grumbling that no such person was in the
street.</p>

<p>“Ah, what a pity!” she said. “I have
not seen my cousin since the Feast of the
Madonna del Carmelo.”</p>

<p>Bertino licked the gum and sealed the
envelope.</p>

<p>“And now, <i>carina</i>,” he said, regarding
her tenderly, “the answer that you promised
to-day.”</p>

<p>“It is ready,” she said, her eye on the
letter. “I will be your wife.”</p>

<p>“Joy!” he cried, and gave her a resonant
kiss that startled two chess-players from their
absorption and evoked a sneer from the <i>caffè</i>
waitress.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p>That night Bertino went with Aunt
Carolina to the ship. Before saying <i>buon
viaggio</i> he handed her the letter for the
sculptor.</p>

<p>“May you guard it well, my aunt!” he
said solemnly. “It is of great value.”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PERPETUA MEETS A BEAR</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> lookout had sighted Genoa, but to
many eager eyes that peered from the rail
there lay naught in the northern distance
save the imperial sapphire sparkling to the
clear and eternal blue. After a while, the
magic wand of proximity touching east and
west, the great Mediterranean gem revealed
its setting; the Riviera di Levante lazily
unfolded her beauty to the eager men and
women in the bow.</p>

<p>There was one passenger whose soul
missed the enchantment. A matter of
greater import filled her mind and dimmed
her vision&mdash;her mission to secure a wife for
Casa Di Bello. She did show an interest in
the fairy picture that was coming out all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>around, but not until the ship had steamed
so far shoreward that the hamlets of the
slopes showed their shining faces through
the mountain greenery. Then she stood intently
regarding the land, her gaze set far
above the white turrets and flaring walls of
the Sea City that took form out of the yellow
summer haze.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>It was Cardinali that Carolina strained
her eyes to discern, and at last she beheld it&mdash;a
weather-beaten little town perched high
on a crag of rock. Then she breathed content
and awaited patiently the time for landing.
Within an hour after her well-shod feet
had pressed the soil she was snugly installed,
trunk and handtraps, in a veteran victoria
drawn by a raw recruit of a horse, whose
youthful antics kept the driver busy. With
her luggage safely at her side and the landing
accomplished without mishap, she settled
back on the cushion and gave herself up to
ease and self-adoration. How much wiser
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>and abler she was than those excitable, nervous
women whom she had left on the quay,
still fuming over their baggage and the customs
examination! Complacently she judged
herself a very superior person, and never before
had she felt on better terms with herself.
The raw recruit trotted decorously
enough past the monument of the Man that
made an Egg stand on End, and clattered
under the marble arch, whereon St. George,
champion of Genoa, was trampling a dragon.
Presently the city lay at her back, and she
began to breathe the good air of home in the
white dust of the highway, the pungent scent
of the sage, the sweetness of the honeysuckle
and oleander.</p>

<p>They began the ascent of the winding
causeway up which Armando had toiled so
sadly with his despised Juno and the Peacock.
Long stretches of wall bordered the
route, which was rough in places and steep,
and not at all to the taste of the youngster
in the traces. He grew cross and nervous,
and shied at such innocent things as a tuft
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>of cowslips on the roadside or an umbel of
clematis on the wall.</p>

<p>“What kind of horse have you there?”
asked Carolina, picking up a valise that had
been jolted from the seat several times.</p>

<p>“What kind of a horse?” repeated the
<i>cocchiere</i>, as though unable to credit his ears.
“Ah, signora, there is none better in all
Genoa; only he is a little green and has had
the staggers once. Verily a fine beast.”</p>

<p>At the bight of a turning a Franciscan
monk came in view suddenly from behind a
thicket of myrtle. He wore the brown robe,
scanty cape and hood on the shoulders, the
girdle of knotted cord, the wooden sandals
of his order. The recruit struck up a dance,
and would have caracoled to the upsetting of
the victoria, had not the monk run forward
and caught his head.</p>

<p>“I regret that I frightened your horse,
signora,” said the friar; “but I think he will
go safely now.”</p>

<p>To the mind of Aunt Carolina, both the
danger and its allayance had sprung from an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>eminently proper source. To be put in peril
by a holy man was a distinction second only
to being rescued by one. In thanking her
deliverer she made known with pride that
she too had been a limb of the Church.</p>

<p>“For eight years, father, was I <i>perpetua</i>
of the rectory in Mulberry.”</p>

<p>The monk crossed himself and trudged on.</p>

<p>They were not far now from the last
squirm of the highway that serpentined to
Cardinali. The angle by the myrtle thicket
doubled, they entered upon a road that for
half a mile was an almost level shelf on the
mountain side. On one hand yawned a
precipice that grew deeper as the road wore
upward, and all that stood between an ungovernable
horse and his driver’s eternity
was a low stone wall built along the margin.
Carolina would have descended from the
vehicle and walked the rest of the way but
for the persuasive driver, who promised her
upon his honour that all would go well now
they had reached a stretch of road that was
not steep. He could assure the signora that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>his horse was kind and gentle at heart, but
coming of a lordly stock he loved not the
menial task of hauling heavy loads uphill.
A person of education like the signora would
understand that. Peril? Not a spark of it
now that the going was smooth and easy.
See! he was behaving better already.</p>

<p>The horse was steadier, and all might
have ended well, but for certain dark objects
that had appeared at this moment from behind
the last bend and were dimly visible
far up the pass. As they drew near, the ears
of the recruit stiffened higher and higher, and
a few short, wild snorts gave further signal of
danger. In the oncoming group was a tall
and sinewy mountaineer, bronze of face and
shock-headed, who led a monkey with one
hand and with the other held the chain of a
large cinnamon bear. By his side, a little
behind, tramped his wife in picturesque rags
and tinsel. She carried a brown baby, and
half dragged along a toddling boy with a
tambourine. When only a dozen rods separated
them from the carriage, the mountebank,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
obeying business instinct, commanded
the bear to rise on his hind paws. With
clumsy alacrity the beast did so, while
the master doffed his hat, and with the
others of the vagabond troop stood lined
on the roadside ready to receive Carolina’s
bounty.</p>

<p class="p2b">The huge brown shape risen so suddenly
in his path was more than the overwrought
nerves of the lordling could stand, and away
he shot, bit and reins a cipher, bent upon
turning out and flying past the mysterious
terror. The hubs of the victoria struck
against the low stone parapet, kept bumping
hard and rapidly from one jagged projection
to another, and do his best the driver could
not steer the maddened animal clear of the
rude masonry. Carolina’s first thought was
to leap into the road rather than be popped
over the wall to sure destruction. She did
not wait for a second thought, but sprang,
and landed by a miracle clear of the wheels,
at the feet of the astonished bear. Another
instant and the inquiring beast would have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>scratched her face or combed her hair, but
his master jerked him back with a mighty
tug at the chain, while the wife, setting down
her baby, leaped to Carolina’s aid. They
carried her to the herbage that fringed the
highway. Then the mountebank set off at
a run for the victoria, which had come to a
standstill at a point where the road assumed
an abrupt steepness. Horse, driver, and vehicle
were faintly discernible through the
powdery clouds thrown up by hoof and
wheel.</p>

coming up with the carriage, which
the recruit was striving to back over the parapet.
“A doctor! The signora has broken
her leg!”</p>

<p>“To Cardinali!” sneered the <i>cocchiere</i>.
“Bah! The beast&mdash;woo-ah, woo!&mdash;he will
mount no higher&mdash;woo-ah, woo!&mdash;and by
San Giorgio, I blame him not.&mdash;There, now,
ugly one, quiet, quiet.&mdash;No; if I go for a
doctor it must be downhill. And you and
your bear!” he added with a scowl at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>showman. “A fine day’s work you have
done. It is men and bears like you two
that I would send to prison. Look at those
hubs. Who will pay the damage? Not
such as you, I warrant. Body of a whale!
Why did I ever come here?”</p>

<p>“You are a wild ass!” returned the
mountebank. “Who but an ass would try
to drive such a horse? My jackanapes has
more sense.”</p>

<p>“<i>Al diavolo</i>, rascal!”</p>

<p>“<i>All’inferno</i>, donkey!”</p>

<p>“Bah!”</p>

<p>“Bah!”</p>

<p class="p2b">Without difficulty the driver turned his
horse in the opposite direction, and at a
contented jog he started downhill toward
the spot where Carolina lay. The showman’s
wife was supporting her head and begging
forgiveness for her husband and the bear.
Presently Sebastiano the Carrier reached the
scene with his empty cart. Did he know
the lady? Some there were who forgot
faces, but not he. Signorina Di Bello. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>was many years since she went away, but he
knew her. Had the sun overcome her? A
broken leg! <i>Dio Santo!</i></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<p class="caption">“A broken leg! <i>Dio Santo!</i>”</p>

<p class="p2">After much vehement talk and excited
gesture the baggage was taken from the
victoria and the injured woman placed, none
too tenderly, in the donkey cart, that being
deemed the only safe course. It was the
same springless wain that had carried Armando’s
Juno and the Peacock on their
fruitless pilgrimage to Genoa. For Carolina
it was simply a car of torture. By
the time it rolled under the arched gate
of Cardinali she was no longer sensible of
pain.</p>

<p>It was the most stupendous event the
village had ever known&mdash;this return of Carolina
Di Bello after an absence of twelve
years, and bumping along over the cobbles
in old Sebastiano’s cart. Every house that
the terrible ambulance passed was straightway
emptied of its inmates, who fell in behind
the cart, clamouring for a view of its unconscious
occupant. She lay as though lifeless,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>her head propped by a travelling bag, her
face exposed to the glare of the sun. No
one thought of covering her face, so eager
were they all to gaze at it and compare her
looks with what they were twelve years before
when she departed for America. The
women discussed her gown and foot gear,
and pronounced them both very <i>signora</i>.
Sebastiano drew up at a flight of broken
stone steps that zigzagged to a porch shaded
by a gnarled fig tree, whereunder a cow-faced
woman stood patiently stirring a copper
vessel of steaming corn-meal mush. The
donkey gave a bray of approval at the
calling of a halt, and the woman, in response
to a general cry, clattered down to
the cart.</p>

<p>“Cousin Carolina! <i>Misericordia!</i> What
has happened? Where did she come from?”</p>

<p>The new actor on the scene was Serafina
Digrandi, aunt of the maid for whose wiving
Carolina had made the disastrous journey;
and, following the mountain usage, she would
have flung herself weeping upon the moveless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
figure of her relative, but the village
doctor broke through the crowd in time to
hold her back and declare the patient still
alive. At this Serafina dried her tears and
began a bustling preparation of the best
room in the house.</p>

<span class="smaller">BIRTH OF THE LAST LADY</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the fractured shin bone had been
set by a surgeon from Genoa, and Carolina
had passed a day and a night in sullen rebellion
at fate, she asked for Marianna.</p>

<p>“She is at the mill, dear cousin,” answered
Serafina.</p>

<p>“What mill?”</p>

<p>“The straw mill, where she is a plaiter.”</p>

<p>“Let her leave it and come to me.”</p>

<p>“But she gains ten <i>soldi</i> a day. How
shall we live if we give up our work?”</p>

<p>“I will make up the ten <i>soldi</i>. Bid her
come.”</p>

<p>So the next dawn did not find Marianna
hastening with lunch hamper down the path
through the fir thicket toward the mill in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>the gorge. But Armando was at the spot
where he met her every morning on her way
to work. And while he watched and worried
under the alders, whose boles the torrent
splashed, Marianna stood at the bedside
of Aunt Carolina. At daybreak she had
entered the room softly, and found the
woman from America awake.</p>

<p>“I have been waiting for you,” she said
faintly. “In the night I remembered a
packet that Bertino gave me for some one
in Cardinali&mdash;a Signor Corrini. It is there,
in the bag. Take it out, and deliver it to
whom it belongs.”</p>

<p>“Signor Corrini! Armando!” cried the
girl. “I will carry it to him at once.” She
started for the door.</p>

<p>“Armando is your <i>amante</i>?”</p>

<p>“<i>Si</i>, aunt.” She blushed, and left the
room, closing the door gently.</p>

<p>“And I the bearer of a message to him!
O Maria! what penance more? All fasts
kept, aves and paternosters said faithfully,
and my reward&mdash;a broken leg!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>Marianna lost no time in delivering the
precious missive to Armando, whom she
found waiting in the gorge at the wonted
place. Without stopping to answer his anxious
inquiries, she placed the fateful packet
in his hands.</p>

<p>“From Bertino,” she said.</p>

<p>“Ah, joy!” he cried, tearing open the
envelope. “What I have waited for so
long! Surely it is the model for my great
work, for the bust that shall make me
famous in America. Bones of St. George!”</p>

<p>He had taken out the portrait of Juno,
and stood glaring at it.</p>

<p>“She has a nose,” Marianna remarked.</p>

<p>“True,” said Armando thoughtfully. “I
wonder if this is American beauty.”</p>

<p>Then he began reading the letter aloud.
At the part that told him it was a portrait
of the wife of the President of the United
States he leaped for gladness, and Marianna
started away to tell all the village. Armando
caught her arm.</p>

<p>“Not a word!” he said; “not a word
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>until the work is done&mdash;nay, until it is delivered
to her Majesty La Presidentessa.”</p>

<p>And a great secret it remained for many
months, during which Armando toiled by
day and night, releasing from the block of
marble the supposed First Lady of the
Land. Marianna saw little of him. When
she ventured to look in at the shop where
he worked, her visit never seemed welcome.
He returned short answers to her questions,
and showed petulance because of the interruption;
and the dreadful truth was borne
in upon her that he had given himself heart
and soul to the woman who took shape from
the marble. One day, when the bust was
almost finished, she said timidly:</p>

<p>“Armando, don’t you love me any
more?”</p>

<p>“What a question! Of course I do,”
and he gave her a hasty kiss. Then he went
on chipping at Juno’s snub nose.</p>

<p>Not at all reassured, Marianna went back
to Aunt Carolina, whose convalescence had
met with a serious setback; but she was out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>of bed now, and talking about returning to
Mulberry by the next ship.</p>

<p>“Sit by my side, <i>carina</i>,” she said. “I
have something to say to you. Soon I shall
go to America. Do you know what a fine
country that is? Well, you shall see. Aunt
Serafina permits it, and I will bear the expense&mdash;and
it is decided that you may go
with me. Ah, how happy you must be to
hear this! How many girls would like to
go, and how few have the chance!”</p>

<p>“But Armando!”</p>

<p>“The <i>amante</i>!” said Carolina scornfully.
“Bah! he is nothing.”</p>

<p>“True enough,” sneered Aunt Serafina.
“All Cardinali knows what he is. A good-for-naught
who will starve when the money
that old Daniello the Image Maker left him
is eaten up.”</p>

<p>“He is no good-for-naught,” said the
girl. “He is a sculptor.”</p>

<p>She could not help defending him then,
but none the less that night she went to bed
with serious thoughts in her head of accepting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
Aunt Carolina’s offer. It was the month
of the finished bust, and with the sense that
Armando no longer cared for her was mingled
a feeling of resentment, which she
vaguely fancied could be expressed most
potently by forsaking him&mdash;leaving him
alone with the stony woman who had
robbed her of his heart. Of course, this
would not have weighed against the love
that was only wounded, had not the tone
of her two aunts taken a ring of command,
instead of solicitation, as the day drew
nearer for Carolina’s departure. Thus it
came to pass that on the very morning that
the bust was carried down the winding road
to Genoa and put aboard a ship for New
York, Marianna said to Armando:</p>

<p>“In three weeks I go to America.”</p>

<p>“You?”</p>

<p>“Yes; with Aunt Carolina.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“She wants me, and you do not love
me.”</p>

<p>“<i>Dio!</i> How can you say that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>“You love her better.”</p>

<p>“Her? <i>Santa Maria!</i> who?”</p>

<p>“I know.”</p>

<p>“Speak!”</p>

<p>“You love the marble woman.”</p>

<p>He caught her in a frenzied embrace,
and imprinted kisses upon her hair, her
glowing cheeks, her lips, and her long,
brown eyelashes.</p>

<p>“<i>Mia vita!</i>” he gasped. “Do you
know what you will do if you talk so?
You will drive me mad! I swear that I
love you better than life. I would die with
you, my angel of God. With every breath
I love you, love you, love you!”</p>

<p>“O Madonna, <i>che peccato!</i> It is too
late! She has the <i>biglietto</i> for the ship.
They say I must go now.”</p>

<p>“Then, by the sword of the saint, I will
go too!”</p>

<p>And go he did on the ship that carried
Carolina and Marianna, though it was not
love alone that drew him after her. In
America his fame was to be erected, and for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>some time he had been thinking that it
would be well for him to be on the spot,
and give Bertino a hand with the architecture.</p>

<p>The white towers of Genoa were still
visible when Carolina came face to face in
the companion way with the <i>amante</i>, from
whom she was felicitating herself she had
separated Marianna forever.</p>

<p>“What is he doing on this ship?” she
demanded of the girl.</p>

<p>“Going to America.”</p>

<p>“Bah! I know that. Is he following
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, signora.”</p>

<p>Of course she tried to keep them apart,
and of course failed drearily every day of the
voyage. While she hunted the vessel over
for them, they would be enjoying a quiet
exchange of confidences in one of the secret
nooks known only to lovers on shipboard.
One day Armando confessed to a hopeless
state of pocket. It had taken well-nigh
every <i>soldo</i> he could raise to pay his passage.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>What he should do to support himself in
America was, he owned, a knotty problem,
but one that could remain unsolved only
until his bust should be seen, admired, and
purchased by the First Lady of the Land.
It had been shipped three weeks before; already
it was in America, and, oh, glorious
thought! perhaps at that very moment
standing upon a costly pedestal in the
White House. Even if her Majesty the
Presidentessa had not found it convenient
as yet to receive it, she would do so in a
fortnight at the longest. Great people like
that always took their time. Meanwhile
had he not Bertino, his bosom friend and
commercial representative in the American
market, to stand by him? With this golden
view Marianna was in full accord, and
his twenty years and her seventeen could
see nothing to worry about in the New
World.</p>

<span class="smaller">A RACE TO THE SWIFT</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> morning that Carolina sailed for
Genoa, Signor Di Bello began to reconsider
the roar of derision with which he had
treated Juno’s matrimonial aims, and before
the day was out he had made up his mind
to possess her as his wife. To be sure, he
had promised Carolina not to marry for
three months, and this pledge, given on his
saint’s day, was of course inviolable; but he
reasoned that there would be no breach of
faith in offering Juno his hand, and having
the nuptials set three months to a day from
the Feast of St. George. He sat in the
shop thinking over the great matter, when
the sunlit floor was darkened by the shadow
of Sara the Frier of Pepper Pods.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>
<p>“<i>Buon giorno</i>, Signor Di Bello,” she said,
in a tone that gave promise sure of more to
follow.</p>

<p>“O Signora Sara, <i>buon giorno</i>.”</p>

<p>“Two cents’ worth of salt, if you please.
<i>Ahimè!</i> Truly these are days of much expense.
Never did I fry peppers that required
so much salt.”</p>

<p>“Ah, <i>si</i>; much expense,” said Signor Di
Bello, yawning and handing her out a two-cent
bag.</p>

<p>From a deep pocket of her skirt she
drew a begrimed canvas money pouch, and
untied a long string with which it was
closed at the top and wound about many
times. Dipping in, she brought forth a
handful of coppers, and selected two.
These she laid on the counter with a sigh,
first feeling of the bag to make sure that it
was packed hard with salt. She looked
about the shop, and stood a moment moving
a red-stockinged foot in and out at the
open heel of her wooden-soled slipper.</p>

<p>“Your nephew not here?” she remarked,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>and then with a chuckle, “With the singer,
<i>neh</i>?”</p>

<p>“What singer?” asked Di Bello.</p>

<p>“Juno.”</p>

<p>“What has he to do with La Superba?”</p>

<p>“More than you think,” returned the
yellow-visaged beldame, nodding her head
mysteriously, while her long gold earrings
jingled. “Listen, and it is I that will tell
you something. Go to the Caffè of the
Beautiful Sicilian if you would know with
whom he spends his time.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“There it is that he meets the <i>cantatrice</i>.”</p>

<p>“Juno?”</p>

<p>“<i>Si</i>, signore.”</p>

<p>“Satan the Pig! Bah! What are you
saying?”</p>

<p>“The truth, signore; the truth, I assure
you. I have it on the word of Lavinia the
waitress. Only yesterday she saw them
kiss.”</p>

<p>The gloating eyes of Sara were fixed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>upon him, and Di Bello did something very
unusual for him&mdash;he dissembled his feelings.</p>

<p>“What of it?” he said with an air of unconcern.
“Why should he not kiss her?
It is no affair of mine.”</p>

<p>Though a good piece of acting, it did
not gammon the keen wits of Sara the
Frier of Pepper Pods. Taking up her bag
of salt, she clattered from the shop, and
before long stood the voluble centre of a
group of eager women, into whose ears she
poured the tidings of rival loves in Casa
Di Bello. Meantime the grocer, waiting for
Bertino, fanned his wrath. When the
young man turned up at the shop this was
his greeting:</p>

<p>“Satan the Pig!”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Bertino.</p>

<p>“And you have the courage to ask?
Very innocent for one who tries to rob me
of the woman I love. O traitor!”</p>

<p>Bertino stood speechless with amazement
and dismay. His good-natured, easy-going
uncle prancing about the place in a fit
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>of passion was a sight that took his breath
away.</p>

<p>“By the Egg of Columbus!” Di Bello
continued, raising his clinched fist and fixing
his eyes upon the loops of dried sausage
suspended from the ceiling&mdash;“by the Egg,
I swear it, if you don’t keep away from that
woman I’ll turn you from my door&mdash;I’ll
have your heart’s blood!”</p>

<p>“What woman?” Bertino asked gingerly,
and with a feint of ignorance that was
not convincing.</p>

<p>“Bah! Don’t play the fool. I know
all. Remember what I tell you&mdash;keep away
from her.”</p>

<p>Bertino went behind the counter, put on
an apron, and held his tongue. By degrees
the padrone’s ire cooled, until he became so
tranquil as to take a chair.</p>

<p>“Listen, my nephew,” he said, sprawling
his legs and thrusting his hands in his pockets.
“I will tell you a secret. This woman
is to be my wife.”</p>

<p>“Your what?” gasped Bertino.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>“My wife. Three months from yesterday
she will be Signora Di Bello. I would
marry her this very day but I promised&mdash;donkey
that I was!&mdash;I promised not to take
a wife for three months; a pledge that I
can’t break, for it was given on San Giorgio’s
Day. Oh, what a donkey!”</p>

<p>Bertino did not dare ask any questions,
but he resolved that something should be
done at once to head off his uncle; not another
day, nay, not a single hour, must pass
until he and Juno should be man and wife.
He found an excuse to leave the shop, and
went to Juno’s humble abode.</p>

<p>“Come with me at once, <i>carissima</i>!”
he cried. “Come to the Church of San
Loretto. It is open to-day for masses, and
Father Bernardo is there. We shall be
married this very hour.”</p>

<p>“Why such haste?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Ah, my angel, can you ask? I wish
to make sure of you&mdash;to know that you are
really mine.”</p>

<p>Together they made their way through
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>Mulberry, walking with step rapid and resolute.
As they entered Elizabeth Street and
approached the portals of San Loretto, Bertino
recollected with a tremor of fear the
threat of his uncle: “If you don’t keep
away from that woman I’ll turn you from
my door&mdash;I’ll have your heart’s blood!”
They were about to ascend the church steps
when he caught Juno by the arm and drew
back.</p>

<p>“Come away from here,” he said hoarsely.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?”</p>

<p>“Come away! We must go to some
other church. Here it is that the pigs of
Sicilians get married. It is no place for a
Genovese like me or a fine Neapolitan like
you. Come, we shall find another priest.”</p>

<p>In secrecy he saw his one chance of saving
himself for the present from the consequences
of openly defying Signor Di Bello.
To be married at the altar of San Loretto,
to which dozens of sharp eyes and gossiping
tongues were always directed in prayer,
would be to proclaim the nuptials to all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>Mulberry before vesper bells should be
rung that day.</p>

<p>He led her through Houston Street and
across the Bowery to a rectory in lower
Second Avenue, a quarter that lies only a
few blocks beyond the frontier of Mulberry,
but with a life as remote and distinct from
that of the Italian colony as though a hundred
leagues of sea divided them. A brief
mumbling in a little parlour, and they were
man and wife.</p>

<p>Neither bride nor bridegroom looked
joyous as they came forth into the street
and moved slowly toward Mulberry. Bertino’s
face was particularly long. He was
in a black study. Throughout his persistent
courtship he had promised Juno that she
should have a home in Casa Di Bello if she
became his wife. Now he found himself
cracking his wits to contrive a good excuse
for keeping her out of his uncle’s sight. If
they met she would be sure to tell him
of the marriage, whereupon <i>inferno</i> would
kindle. With a wife on his hands, he would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>find himself homeless and out of employment,
even if Di Bello’s <i>vendetta</i> did not
remove the need of earning a living. He
dared not make a confidante of his wife, for
to do so meant disclosure of the ugly truth
that he had cheated her of the richest husband
in Mulberry&mdash;of a prize which he
knew she had been eager to win. His heart
sank at thought of the terrible <i>vendetta</i> that
<i>she</i> might take. He believed her capable
of forsaking him and setting their union at
naught. Silent of tongue and sore bestead,
he moved along slowly, while passers-by eyed
the majestic woman at his side. When
they had reached St. Patrick’s Graveyard,
and her glance fell on Casa Di Bello, she
said:</p>

<p>“Now that we are married, let us go to
your uncle and tell him, so that I may move
in over there. When that is done we can
have the marriage before the mayor, and
the wedding feast.”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” he said; “not yet, for the
love of Dio!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>“Why?” she demanded. “I am as good
as any one in that house.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my precious one, it is not that;
not that. Listen. There is my uncle&mdash;a
good man, but strange, strange. When I
told him I should take a wife he called me
fool and got very angry. He said I would
not do my work so well if I took a wife.
But you&mdash;ah, you, my angel!&mdash;I would not
give you up for all the uncles and shops in
New York&mdash;yes, in all America.”</p>

<p>“You talk nonsense,” said Juno. “Tell
me why I should not live in Casa Di Bello.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is for this, <i>carissima</i>, only this:
I am afraid to tell him just now that I am
married, because he said he would put me
out&mdash;do you understand?&mdash;said he would
put me out of the shop and Casa Di Bello
if I got married. In a few weeks&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Bah!” she said, waving a forefinger in
Neapolitan fashion, meaning that she was
not to be taken in. “I never believed you
when you talked of Casa Di Bello. Do you
think it was for that I married you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>“Wait, wait, my Juno. <i>Pazienza.</i> The
day will come when you will be <i>padrona</i> of
that house.”</p>

<p>“Enough,” she said. “I am tired of this
nonsense. What are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“Listen,” said Bertino, delighted at the
success of his garbled version of Di Bello’s
threat. “This is my idea: You do not like
Mulberry too well, nor do I. Moreover,
rents are very high here, because these animals
find it hard to get in anywhere else,
and the landlords rob them. But with us it
is different. We, for example, are signori,
are we not?”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes; I am a signora.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Now I will tell you the
rest: In the upper city there are apartments,
small and fine, that we could take. You
know Giacomo Goldoni, the cornetist at La
Scala? Well, he lives in a place like that,
he and his wife, just like Americans.”</p>

<p>“Where is it?”</p>

<p>“In One Hundred and Eleventh Street
of the East. Do you know where that is?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>Well, you can find it. To-day you shall go
and choose the place. Here is money, the
first that you have received from your husband.
Do you think I have been fool
enough to give the money I brought from
Italy to the pothouses? Not I. When I
need money I go to the Bank of Risparmio.
See what kind of a husband you have!
Neither you nor any one else knows how
much I have in the bank. I will tell <i>you</i>.
Before drawing this five yesterday I had
fifty-three dollars.”</p>

<p>Juno expressed her contempt in a glance,
but she closed her fingers on the greenback.</p>

<p>“Very well. I go to look for the apartment.
This evening we meet. Where?
At the Caffè of the Beautiful Sicilian?”</p>

<p>“No, no; not there!” said Bertino.
“You must not come to Mulberry.”</p>

<p>“Why?” she demanded, eying him
closely.</p>

<p>He made the only answer that could
have satisfied her:</p>

<p>“It is no place for such a signora as you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>They appointed another meeting place&mdash;one
that lay beyond the zone of Signor Di
Bello’s nightly revels, and with a wave of
the hand Juno took leave of her husband.
He watched her proudly as her stately figure
moved toward the Bowery. She carried
her head with the dignity of the ladies she
had seen driving in the Chiaja of Naples on
a sunny afternoon.</p>

<p>Bertino returned to the shop in Paradise
Park. As he picked his way through the
swarms of children on the sidewalk he
thought of his uncle sitting in the sunlight,
all unwary that the prize he coveted had
passed to another. And the elation of the
conqueror gave a spring to his step, and a
swagger, until he turned a corner and beheld
the sign of the Wooden Bunch.
Then misgiving filled his soul and restored
his trudging pace, his peasant gait&mdash;misgiving
that the vanquished one might exact
an accounting.</p>

<p>“Soul of a lobster!” cried Di Bello,
springing from his chair, when the young
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>man appeared at the door. “Where the
crocodile have you been? Animal! To
keep me waiting like this, and a grand game
of <i>bastoni</i> to be played at the Three Gardens.
By the Dragon, you are going too
far!”</p>

<p>He flung out of the shop, not waiting to
hear Bertino’s lame excuse.</p>

<p>That evening, after the shop was closed,
Bertino and Juno visited a large instalment
house in the Bowery and made their selection
of furniture.</p>

<p>“We shall not need much,” he said,
mindful of his balance in the bank, “for in
a little while we shall live in Casa Di Bello.”</p>

<p>“Casa Di Bello!” sneered Juno. “Do
you think I am a fool?”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when two months of living
in the little dark flat had brought her
no nearer the inside of the Di Bello house,
where her husband continued to live in
order to avert suspicion, she became impatient,
disgusted. The few hours a week
that he could steal from the shop to visit
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>her were not the happiest in his life. She
grew sullen and entertained him with fault-finding.
Of his poverty she never lost an
opportunity to twit him, and called him a
cheat for marrying her. At last she declared
that she would not stay there alone any
longer. If a man took a wife and could not
live with her and support her like a Christian
he had better give her up. And he
talked of money! Why did he not bring
her good things from the grocery? For two
months she had lived on bread and <i>salame</i>
half the time, with an occasional feast of
lupine beans and veal that he brought her
from Mulberry. And what veal! In Naples
it would not be permitted to sell such
young meat. Perhaps it was good enough
for the wives of the Mulberry cattle, but it
would not do for her to live that way. She
had been a fool to put up with it as long as
she had&mdash;a woman like her!&mdash;when she could
go on the stage and live as a signora should.
Yes, she could get a place on the stage, and
it would not be an Italian theatre either.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>Goldoni the cornetist had left La Scala and
was playing in the orchestra of a Broadway
theatre, the great Titania. The other day
she met him, and she did not let on that she
was married. See how well she could keep
a secret!&mdash;but she was a fool for doing so.
Well, Goldoni was a man. He said that he
could get her a place in the Titania without
any trouble. In fact, the <i>impresario</i> would
be glad to engage her. She would be the
finest shape in the company. It would be
twelve dollars a week sure for a figure such
as hers, Signor Goldoni had assured her.
Why, then, should she remain at home
nights waiting for a good-for-nothing of a
husband, who never brought her anything
better than bob veal?</p>

<p>Bertino pleaded with her to be patient
and all would end well. By the Feast of
San Giovanni, if not before, it would be
safe to reveal the secret of his marriage,
when, he could promise her, his good-tempered
uncle would forgive him, and invite
them both to make their home in Casa Di
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>Bello. As for his aunt, she would not be
here to interfere.</p>

<p>“Your aunt will not be here?” asked Juno,
who recognised in Carolina her bitterest foe.</p>

<p>“No. She has broken her leg, and will
not return to America for a long time. The
news came yesterday.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Bertino pressed the bell button of
the flat a week afterward the electric lock of
the street door did not click its customary
“come in.” For several minutes he kept up
a serenade. At length a thunderous voice
sounded through the speaking tube:</p>

<p>“She’s out. Get out!”</p>

<p>It was Juno’s first night on the stage of
the Titania. She had taken the engagement
without deeming it worth while to
inform her husband. Bertino returned to
Mulberry, at first greatly alarmed for her
safety, but in turn filled with most dreadful
imaginings as to the cause of her absence.
The following night he got a similar response
to his <i>sonata</i> on the bell, but, instead of going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
away in a half-distracted state of mind,
he lingered in the doorway, or paced to and
fro before the house. To-night he was not
merely a husband worried because his wife
was missing. His alert eye and grimly patient
air bespoke a more serious matter.
Whether walking, standing, or sitting on the
steps he was careful not to take one of his
hands&mdash;the right&mdash;out of his coat pocket.
It was after midnight when he caught sight
of her. The white glare of an electric light
brought her suddenly into view as she turned
the corner. He tightened his grip on the
thing in his pocket, but as she drew near and
it was certain that she had no companion
save a small valise, he came forth from the
shadow in which he had crouched when the
purpose of dealing her a deadly thrust was
full upon him. She started back, but quickly
regained her frigid calm.</p>

<p>“You’ve had a fine wait,” she said.</p>

<p>“Where have you been?” he demanded,
for the first time speaking to her in a tone
that smacked of authority.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>“Working and earning money,” she answered&mdash;“money
that you ought to give
me.”</p>

<p>“Working? Where?”</p>

<p>“In the theatre&mdash;the great Titania.
Bah! You never even heard of it. Do you
know where Broadway is?”</p>

<p>He did not resent her scornful words.
The motive for killing her having passed, he
was again her blind worshipper. Producing
her latchkey she opened the door.</p>

<p>“Come in,” she said. “I have something
to say to you.” And when they had
entered the flat: “You must come to the
theatre and walk home with me every night
after the representation. At the stage door
you must wait. There are beasts who will
not let a woman be when she is alone at
night. I have been annoyed enough.”</p>

<p>“Who has annoyed you?” said Bertino,
springing up and putting his hand in the
stiletto pocket, now as eager to slay the
offender as he had been to knife her a few
minutes before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>“No matter. To-morrow night and every
night you be there at the stage door.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Signor Di Bello sought in vain to get a
trace of Juno. The <i>impresario</i> of La Scala
could not give him any clew. He visited all
the concert halls and singing <i>caffès</i> of Mulberry,
as well as the Italian theatres of Little
Italy in the Upper East End. Not a soul
knew anything about her. One day he said
to Bertino:</p>

<p>“That woman Juno has flown like the
bluebird that used to light on the Garibaldi
statue. Do you know where she is?”</p>

<p>“How should I know? You threaten
to kill me if I do not keep away from her,
and then ask me where she is!”</p>

<p>“It is a grand mystery,” mused Di Bello,
throwing out his legs and lying back in his
chair. “Just when I am ready to marry her
she takes wing.”</p>

<p>“Ah, <i>si</i>,” said Bertino meditatively&mdash;“a
grand mystery.”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PEACE PRESERVED</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> Juno’s sudden disappearance the
theatre and the <i>caffès</i> of Mulberry lost their
charm for Signor Di Bello. He began to
roam abroad evenings in quest of amusement.
There came to him a newborn
desire to explore the region of American
life that lay beyond the colony’s border.
For twelve years he had dwelt in its heart
and felt the throb of the big city; but never
before had it struck his mind to know more
of this <i>terra misteriosa</i> than he could learn
from the morning <i>Araldo</i> and the evening
<i>Bolletino</i>, two local scions of the corybantic
press, which bawled the news of Mulberry
in double-column scares, but only whispered
in paragraphs of the affairs of New York.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>With sixty thousand others Mulberry was
his world. He had never sought acquaintance
with the great American monster whose
roar filled the surrounding air by day and
whose million eyes at night gave the northern
sky a dim, false dawn.</p>

<p>From visiting Bowery shows he became
a patron of the vaudeville theatres farther up
town. At length he discovered the Tenderloin,
with its dazzling electric displays at the
doors of theatres and drinking places, its
phantom gaiety. Resolved to sound the
depths of this ocean of lights, he went
along with a current that flowed to the box
office of the Titania, where the glittering
Aztec spectacle, “Zapeaca” was the magnet,
charged with “one hundred American
beauties.”</p>

<p>“By Cristoforo Colombo, it is she!”
the grocer exclaimed, as the woman he had
hunted in a cityful marched across the stage,
bringing up the rear of a long column
of high-heeled warriors. Though disguised
in a tin spear, a pasteboard shield, and a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>sheening helmet set jauntily upon her bounteous
raven mane, he knew her at first sight.
No mistaking that snub nose, that grand
carriage, the plethora of her line, the Eastern
warmth of her colour.</p>

<p>“<i>Brava!</i>” he cried out, from his seat
near the footlights whenever the row of
beauties to which she belonged showed
themselves in marching order. It was a renewal
of the transport into which her presence
had thrown him when in solitary pride
she held the stage of La Scala and bleated
“Santa Lucia.” To the jeers of the people
about him he paid no heed, but gave wild,
vociferous expression to his delight at finding
her and feasting his eyes upon her, as
she stood there in all the truth of the ballet’s
scant drapery.</p>

<p>After the performance he waited in front
of the theatre until the lights were extinguished
and the big doors slammed in his
face. Well it was for the public peace that
his education did not include a knowledge
of the stage door, for had he gone round the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>corner to that entrance not only would he
have encountered Juno, but he would have
witnessed the infuriating afterpiece of Bertino
taking her arm and carrying her off toward
the East side. It is not unlikely that
one steel blade at least would have gleamed
in the half light of that by-street. But his
innocence as to the right door at which to
await a lady of the ballet caused a postponement
of the tragedy. When at last he
sought the advice of a cabman and was
directed to the proper place it was too
late.</p>

<p>“<i>Satana porco!</i>” he growled as he started
homeward. “I am a grand donkey. This is
Saturday. To-morrow is <i>festa</i>. Two whole
days must I go without seeing her. But on
Monday night we shall meet, and then she
shall be my promised wife.”</p>

<p>At the same time Juno was telling Bertino
of her determination to go with the
“Zapeaca” company in a tour of the country.
They talked as they moved along on foot
toward the Third Avenue Elevated. “It is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>only ten dollars a week,” she said, “with all
expenses save the railroad to pay; but what
would you have? Is it not better than living
here the way you support me? Perhaps
you think I will spend my money. Not
even in a dream! A woman expects her
husband to support her. To-morrow night,
then, I go.”</p>

<p>“How long shall you be absent?” asked
Bertino humbly.</p>

<p>“Goldoni says six months anyway; perhaps
longer.”</p>

<p>“You will come back to me?”</p>

<p>“Yes”&mdash;and after a pause&mdash;“when you
can support me like a signora.”</p>

<p>“In six months!” said Bertino exultantly.
“Ha! then I shall be my own <i>padrone</i>.
Then you shall see what a man
your husband is.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Armando’s bust will be here. Don’t
you remember? The bust that shall bring
us both fortune. Patience, patience, my
precious. Mark what I say: With the grand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>marble of the First Lady of the Land once
in my hands I shall quickly put my uncle in
a sack. In his face I will snap my fingers
and say, ‘I beg to inform you, signore, that
Juno is my wife.’”</p>

<p>She made no answer, and Bertino went
on building airy mansions of the golden
harvest to follow the sale of the sculpture
then under way as well as that to be reaped
from other marbles to be turned out of Armando’s
far-off workshop. His words affected
Juno in a manner that he little kenned.
She had given herself only a fugitive
thought as to what might happen when the
bust should arrive and Bertino should find
it an image of his own wife instead of the
wife of the President of the United States.
When the critical moment came, when the
fruit of her roguery stood unveiled, she felt
that she should be equal to it&mdash;that she could
shrug her shoulders and meet Bertino’s suspicions
with a simple plea of ignorance, and
trust to his believing that he himself sent the
wrong photograph by mistake. Now she perceived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
that it behooved her to keep friends
with him, to guile him with affection, else his
suspicion when he should discover the fraud
might take the cast of sullen conviction, and
in Mulberry who can tell what a husband
may do with a false wife, whatever the shade
of her duplicity may be? Moreover, she
wanted the bust. Her rude self-conceit
thirsted for that effigy in stone of her own
dear self. To lose it would be to miss the
prize on which she had set her desire when
she said “Yes” that day in the Caffè of the
Beautiful Sicilian.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes,” she replied when they stood
on the Elevated platform. “We shall put
your uncle in a sack and get along well together
when the bust is here.”</p>

<p>“<i>Brava</i>, my wife!” said Bertino, and
they entered the train.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Next day being the Feast of Sunday,
Bertino and his uncle met at the noon repast
in Casa Di Bello, as they had done every
Sunday since Carolina’s absence. The grocer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>was in jubilant spirits, unable to contain his
joy over the finding of Juno.</p>

<p>“Ah, nephew mine,” he said, when Angelica
had set a large bowl of steaming chestnut
soup on the board and retired to her
listening place. “Not many days, <i>caro mio</i>,
and we shall have a fine woman at table with
us. Yes, a woman truly magnificent.”</p>

<p>“Who is she?”</p>

<p>“The woman who is to be my wife. I
told you once. Can you not divine?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will tell you, though it is a great
secret: Juno the Superb.”</p>

<p>A spoonful of soup that Bertino was in
the act of swallowing took the wrong course
and choked him, while Angelica was thrown
from her balance at the head of the kitchen
stairs and almost fell to the bottom. When
Bertino had stopped coughing he gasped:</p>

<p>“Juno the Superb?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Is it not famous?”</p>

<p>“Your wife?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Ah, what joy!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>“But it is impossible!”</p>

<p>“Not at all, nephew mine. I have found
her. I saw her last night for the first time
since the Feast of San Giorgio. Ah, how I
had searched! It was in the theatre that I
saw her&mdash;at the Titania, a grand spectacle.
So many women, and beautiful! But not
one was the equal of Juno. My word of
honour for that. Well, I waited after the
representation, but did not see her. To-morrow
night, though, I shall say to her:
‘Juno, be my wife. In three months come
to my house, to Casa Di Bello.’ These
words will I say to her, and I shall wait at
the stage door until she comes out.”</p>

<p>“You will wait many months, then,”
said Bertino to himself with a smothered
chuckle as he fell upon a patty of codfish
that Angelica had just brought in.</p>

<p>“Grand trouble, grand trouble,” sighed
Angelica, as she prepared the after-dinner
<i>zabaglioni</i><a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> for her master. “If the signorina<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
were here he would not dare bring her
to the house. And when she comes and
finds the singer has been in Casa Di Bello!
O Maria&mdash;<i>grandissimo</i> trouble!”</p>

<p>In the evening Bertino accompanied
Juno to the Grand Central Depot, whence
she left for Buffalo with the rest of the hundred
American beauties of the “Zapeaca”
aggregation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On Tuesday morning Bertino regarded
his uncle quizzically across the breakfast
table, but of his second fruitless visit to
the Titania’s stage door the signore was as
silent as the figure of San Patrizio that
looked down upon Casa Di Bello from the
architrave of the church on the opposite side
of Mulberry Street. And for many a day
thereafter not a word did he utter concerning
any magnificent woman that was to become
his wife.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PEACE DISTURBED</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> bluebird came again to perch on
Garibaldi’s cap, the baby maples put forth
their leaves, and Signor Di Bello told Bertino
it was time to give the Wooden Bunch
a new coat of yellow. Once more the fire-escapes
on either side of Corso di Mulberry
bloomed with potted geraniums; glistening
radishes lent their vernal blush to the
vegetable stalls, and the thoughts of Sara
the Frier of Pepper Pods turned to summer
profits. The building trades had set the
winter idlers to work, and the Alley of the
Moon resounded no longer with the wild
shouts of <i>mora</i> players. The hokey-pokey
man, tiding over the cold months with an
ancient hand organ, yearned to put away
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>The Blue Danube and The Marseillaise, and
wheel out his gorgeous ice-cream cart. The
old gondolier, selling pine-cone seeds at the
foot of China Hill, could leave his toe-toaster
at home now, and let the May sunshine
economize the charcoal.</p>

<p>Bertino mixed the paint, selected a cheap
brush from the stock of the shop, and set to
work on the Bunch. It is doubtful that he
heard the swish, swish of the brush. His
thoughts were of Juno. Her absence had
extended long over the six months, and for
more than thirty days he had not heard from
her. There was no excuse for this neglect,
he reasoned, since her education had been
so liberal that she could spell and write as
well as any woman in Mulberry. Of the
few letters received from her, each had contained
a tale of woe&mdash;the woe of a ballet
lady striving to live on the road with a salary
of ten dollars a week. The missives,
rich in terms of endearment, always touched
his pocket as well as his heart, and by return
mail he never failed to send her a dollar or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>two. But why had she been silent this last
month of the tour, instead of writing to tell
him where to meet her when she should
reach the city? Already she ought to be
here. What if she never came back&mdash;if she
forsook him? In the shock of this terrible
thought he upset the pail of yellow just as
Signor Di Bello stepped out of the shop.</p>

<p>“Soul of a cat!” exclaimed the grocer,
the toe of one of his black shoes tipped
with the paint. “What the rhinoceros are
you about? <i>Gran Dio</i>, what stupendous
stupidity!”</p>

<p>Re-entering the shop, he cleaned off the
paint, fuming the while and growling.
Then he flew out, scowling at Bertino as
he passed, and made straight for the Caffè
of the Three Gardens.</p>

<p>“The monkey!” said Bertino to himself.
“When the bust arrives I’ll be rid of him.”</p>

<p>A moment afterward the letter carrier
handed him a large envelope addressed in
a big, round hand to “Bertino Manconi,
Esq.” It was from a customhouse agent,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>announcing the arrival of the bust, and
offering to attend to the business of clearing
it. To this end it would be necessary for
Bertino to forward the amount of the duty,
a hundred and forty dollars. He put the letter
in his pocket, filled with apprehension of
trouble, for his English was so weak that he
could not make out the meaning of the part
about the duty, though he suspected that
the sum of a hundred and forty dollars was
in some way required of him. That evening,
after he had lugged in the Wooden
Bunch and locked the shop door, he took
the mysterious paper to Signor Tomato,
who told him the awful truth.</p>

<p>“It must be a great work of art,” said
the banker; “very valuable.”</p>

<p>“Valuable!” said Bertino. “Ah, <i>caro
mio</i>, if you only knew! Well, I will tell
you. It is a bust of her Majesty the Presidentessa.”</p>

<p>“What Presidentessa?”</p>

<p>“Of the United States.”</p>

<p>“St. Januarius! Is it possible?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span></p>

<p>One hundred and forty dollars! The sum
rose like an impassable mountain between
Bertino and the hopes he had cherished so
long and fervidly. As well have been forty
thousand. He could not pay the duty.
Marriage had eaten up the savings brought
from Italy and what he had earned since.
When Signor Tomato told him that the
Government would retain the marble until
the impost were paid, he blotted out the
poor lad’s fondest anticipations&mdash;his dreams
of release from Signor Di Bello and the
misery of his secret marriage, the freedom
to say to his uncle, “Juno is my wife.” To
the bust he had looked forward as to a loyal
friend, who should come some day to lift
him to the plane whereon a man ought to
stand. But now that the friend was near,
some power which he comprehended but
vaguely had clapped her in a prison, from
which the future held no promise of letting
her go. There came over him the terrible
throbbing of blood and the fire of brain that
he felt the night he crouched, burning with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>suspicion, in the doorway with a ready knife
waiting for Juno. He could not have answered
if asked just now whom he wished
to kill. Some infernal prank was playing
at his expense, and the time had come to
end it. A strange calm possessed him as he
began to cast about for the joker. He had
been walking in Mulberry Street. At the
corner of Spring Street he entered the Caffè
of the Three Gardens. Dropping into a
chair near the door, he ordered a glass of
Marsala; but before the waiter had returned
with the wine, Bertino sprang up
and darted out of the place. At a table
in the <i>caffè’s</i> depth he had seen Juno and
Signor Di Bello with their heads together!
Holy blood of the angels!</p>

<p>No need of looking further for the
joker. His wife returns after six months,
does not let her husband know, and goes
first to meet another. Yes, the prank has
gone far enough.</p>

<p>It was only a block to Casa Di Bello.
In a few minutes he was there and in his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>room. When he came into the street again
he had his right hand in his coat pocket.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The meeting of Juno and Signor Di
Bello came about in this manner: The
signore was walking in Mulberry Street,
on his way to the <i>caffè</i> to smoke an after-dinner
Cavour, and help some good comrades
empty a flask of Chianti. Suddenly
he stopped, stood still, his eyes staring and
his mouth a gulf of astonishment.</p>

<p>“By the Egg of Columbus!” he exclaimed.
“It is she, or I am dreaming!”</p>

<p>There she was, moving toward him on
the same side of the street, dressed no better
than when he last came face to face with
her, but her grand air not a whit impaired.</p>

<p>“At last, at last I find you!” he cried,
catching up her hand and kissing it with a
loud smack. “Ah! the good God knows
how I have hunted for you. But joy, joy!
I find you! I see you! My eyes look into
yours! Come, away from here! Ah, the
Three Gardens! Let us enter. I have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>something to say&mdash;something very important.”</p>

<p>He drew her into the <i>caffè</i>, and sought a
table far from the door.</p>

<p>“What do you want to say to me?”
asked Juno. She had responded not at all
to Signor Di Bello’s passionate greeting.</p>

<p>“Ah, my angel! I want to say to you
what I would have said long ago if I had
found you. The hunt I have had! And
once when I caught sight of you, it was
only to have you vanish again like a wine
bubble. Where have you been? How
beautiful you are! Oh, the grand hunt!”</p>

<p>“Why have you hunted for me?” she
said, releasing her hand from his, and moving
her chair.</p>

<p>“To offer you what you demanded&mdash;a
wedding ring.”</p>

<p>“You wish to make me your wife?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Before the Madonna, it is true!
Months and months ago I was ready.”</p>

<p>For a moment Juno was silent, contemplative.
Then she said, eying him steadily:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>“Would you have married me before I
left Mulberry?”</p>

<p>“Yes; <i>Dio</i> my witness.”</p>

<p>“Why did you not come to me and
say so?”</p>

<p>“But I could not find you. My nephew,
Bertino, will tell you that I speak truth. I
told him that I intended to make you my
wife.”</p>

<p>“When did you tell him that?” she asked
quickly, leaning forward and awaiting the
answer eagerly, while Signor Di Bello strove
to recollect.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, now I have it,” he said at
length. “I remember because it was the
day after my sister Carolina sailed for Genova&mdash;two
days after the Feast of San
Giorgio, my saint.”</p>

<p>The recollection rose clear to Juno that
it was on the day following Carolina’s departure
that she and Bertino went to the
little rectory in Second Avenue. And
equally vivid to her consciousness stood
forth the inflaming truth that Bertino, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>full knowledge of Signor Di Bello’s purpose
to take her for wife, had hastened their
union in order to checkmate his rival. So
this moneyless clerk had tricked her into
marriage, and cheated her of a rich husband!</p>

<p>“<i>Maledetto!</i>” she said in a half-stifled
voice. At the same instant there flashed in
her brain a resolve to rid herself of Bertino.</p>

<p>“Why <i>maledetto</i>?” asked the signore.
“Do you not accept my offer?”</p>

<p>“Another time I will give you my answer,”
she said, rising. “I must go.”</p>

<p>They stood outside, he holding her hand
and looking up into her face with worshipful
eyes. Suddenly she drew back, and
without a parting word took herself off. A
face that she had seen in a near-by doorway
made her eager to end the interview. She
had gone but a few paces when Bertino
was by her side.</p>

<p>“So you are here, and putting horns on
your husband?” he said, gripping her arm.
“Welcome, signora, welcome!” A smile
of hellish mockery played on his livid face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>“No, I am not,” she pleaded, a tremor
in her voice, because she knew her race.</p>

<p>He laughed, and gripped her arm tighter.</p>

<p>“I know,” he said. “You want a rich
man.” Then, with his lips close to her ear:
“Do you think you will live?”</p>

<p>“It is not my fault,” she said, still pleading.
“What can a woman do when a man
plays the fool and annoys her?”</p>

<p>“He annoys you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered, seizing her chance.
“If you were a man you would make him
leave me alone. I do not want him.”</p>

<p>“I will kill the dog!” said Bertino, letting
go of her arm. A moment he regarded
her with the old tenderness, but a black look
settled again on his face, and he asked slowly,
“Why did you not let me know you
were back?”</p>

<p>“I have not been in the city an hour.
The shop was closed. Luigia the Garlic
Woman will tell you that I asked her if she
knew where you had gone. I was going to
send a note to Casa Di Bello. We met in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>the street and&mdash;he annoyed me.” She
thought now only of saving herself.</p>

<p>“By the heart of Mary!” he said, “this
shall stop. I will go to him and tell him
you are my wife.”</p>

<p>“No, no! Don’t do that. Wait&mdash;wait
until you are rid of him&mdash;until you are your
own <i>padrone</i>&mdash;until the bust is here and you
have sold it and are a free man.”</p>

<p>“The bust?” he said hopelessly. “It is
here, but as well might it have remained in
Armando’s studio.”</p>

<p>“What?” she said. “It is here? Where?
Let me see it.”</p>

<p>“No; I can not. The Government has
it, and will keep it until I pay one hundred
and forty dollars. Seven hundred <i>lire</i>!
<i>Gesù Bambino!</i> Where shall I get them?”</p>

<p>As they walked on he recounted the distress
that had overtaken the supposed First
Lady of the Land; her captivity in the
hands of revenue officials, and his inability
to pay the kingly ransom demanded. This
news was a cut and thrust at the hope
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>whereon Juno’s crude self-love had fed for
many a month, and it killed the solitary
motive that made her hold to Bertino. By
neither word nor sign, however, did she betray
her disgust and anger; she even feigned
sympathy, and bade him be of good cheer,
saying tenderly that ill fortune would not
dog them forever; that by luck or pluck
they should get possession of the bust, and
carry out his plan for money-making. These
were the first heartening words she had ever
spoken to him&mdash;the first kindness he could
recall as coming from her lips. Despite the
black cloud that had risen so suddenly from
behind the customhouse, a sweet rapture
filled his soul. What mattered it all?&mdash;his
wife loved him. Their joys and griefs were
one. The loneliness that had burdened his
spirit since the day of his marriage departed,
and his heart lost its bitterness.</p>

<p>“True, my precious,” he said, pressing her
hand, “we love each other, and shall know
how to manage in spite of the Government.”</p>

<p>At the same time Juno said to herself,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>“How can I get rid of the fool and marry
his uncle?”</p>

<p>They came to a halt at the mouth of the
Alley of the Moon, a wide passage between
two tenements that led to a rear court
heaped with push-carts laid up for the night.
Halfway up the alley a large gas lamp with
a sputtering light hung over a doorway. On
its green glass showed the words, Restaurant
of Santa Lucia. In three dingy rooms
above, Luigia the Garlic Woman lived with
a lodger known to the public of Mulberry
as Chiara the Hair Comber. The latter
had her shop and living apartment in the
“front” room, looking on the alley, and
directly over the green light, which shed its
rays on her sign, Hair Combing in Signora
Style, Two Cents. The remaining room
of the trio had been engaged that day by
Juno, who had merely fibbed when she told
Bertino that she had been in town only an
hour. It was the same humble chamber she
had occupied during her brief career of starhood
on the stage of La Scala.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>

<p>“I have come here because it costs only
twenty <i>soldi</i> a day,” she said to Bertino, “and
here I shall remain until&mdash;until we can do
better. Good night, my dear husband.
Courage. Be <i>allegro</i>, and our fortune will
sing.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes; <i>allegro</i> I will be. Good night,
my precious wife. Until to-morrow.”</p>

<p>In the solitude of her dreary little coop,
while the hoarse shouts of <i>mora</i> players in
the restaurant below sounded in her ears,
Juno set her wits calmly to the knotty puzzle
that the day had brought forth: How to get
rid of her husband that she might accept
Signor Di Bello’s offer of marriage? A few
grains of poison dropped in wine for Bertino
to drink would accomplish the needful state
of widowhood, but this method, she discerned,
had its faults. It was likely to bring man-hunters
from the Central Office about one’s
head, and detectives were given to putting
awkward questions. Moreover, they had a
trick of locking up persons whose answers
did not suit them. No; in a strictly private
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>matter of this kind it would never do to have
the police meddling. That might spoil all.
She thought of other plans of removal that
she had heard talked about in the Porto
quarter of Naples. And while she considered
these there darted into her mind one
of those mystic shafts of memory that come
unbidden by cognate suggestion. It was a
Sunday afternoon, and she and Bertino,
walking in the suburbs, stood upon Washington
Bridge. From the height of the
great span she looked down again on the
slopes of the Harlem Valley beautiful in
the gold and flame of autumn; the sedge
marshes that waved to the temperate wind,
and far below, growing narrow in the distance,
the silvery ribbon of water that glimmered
yet faintly in the gloam of sunset.
It was one of those Sundays that Bertino
brought her a package of bob veal, and she
recalled the desire that had seized her to
throw him over the parapet. Had she done
so in the darkness that soon fell not a soul
would have known. What she could have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>done then she could do now. By this method
there would be no police knocking at one’s
door and prying into secrets. The quicker
he were out of the way the better, and next
Sunday, if no moon shone, the thing could
be done. With deep satisfaction she viewed
her brawny arms and stalwart frame and felt
sure of the strength needful to execute the
task without bungling. Then she went to
bed and slept soundly.</p>

<p class="p2b">But the morrow had in its teeth a fine
marplot for her little tragedy. It happened
in the evening in this wise: The shutters of
the shop put up, Bertino hastened to the
Restaurant of Santa Lucia, where Juno had
promised to await him. He opened the
door, and what he saw caused him to pause
on the threshold, but for only a moment.
She was not alone. Seated by her side on
the rough wooden bench that flanked the
long oil-clothed table was Signor Di Bello.
Their backs were turned to the door, but
Bertino knew both at first glance. On the
opposite side of the board the gaslight fell
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>upon a row of dusky faces, into the caverns
of which large quantities of spaghetti coiled
about forks were being despatched. In other
parts of the low-ceiled room, muggy with
smoke of two-cent cigars, coatless men, engaged
in furious combats at cards, shouted
and rained sledge-hammer blows on the
tables. Before any one had seen him enter,
Bertino sprang across the floor like a jaguar
and snatched from his uncle’s hand a knife
with which he was in the act of conveying
a bit of sheep’s-milk cheese to his mouth.
Then without ado the gudgeon who believed
that his wife was annoyed fell to the performance
of a husband’s duty. It was a wild
thrust, but well enough aimed to have found
a mortal course had the tool been of the
standard pattern used in Mulberry for odd
jobs of this kind&mdash;the long thin steel, fine
tempered, and needlelike of point. As it
chanced, Signor Di Bello’s left shoulder
blade was stabbed flesh deep, and a second
lunge only slit his coat sleeve, because he
dropped sidewise out of harm’s way just as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>Bertino brought down the knife again.
Every eye in the restaurant had witnessed
the second blow and the fall of Signor Di
Bello from the end of the bench, so the conclusion
was instant and general that the odd
job had been finished.</p>

<a id="illo5"><img src="images/i_170.jpg" width="564" alt="It was a wild thrust!" title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">It was a wild thrust.</p>

<p class="p2">“Fly!” they cried, one and all, rising and
pointing to the door. “Your work is done.”</p>

<p>Bertino stood a moment, grasping the
knife and looking at Juno; then he flung it
down and made for the door. One of the
card players held it open for him as he passed
out; for the <i>vendetta</i> is a man’s sacred right&mdash;a
strictly private matter to be settled by
him in his own way, free of outside interference.
Enough that he use the genteel knife
and not the clumsy pistol, which is seldom
sure of its mark, and brings the police to
make trouble for one’s friends.</p>

<span class="smaller">YELLOW BOOTS AND ORANGE BLOSSOMS</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Never</span> had a knife-play produced such
general commotion in Mulberry. Though
the motive for a removal was an affair wherewith
outsiders seldom concerned themselves,
the whole colony thirsted in this distinguished
instance to know the wherefore of Bertino’s
desire to have his uncle’s life. This was a
tidal wave of opportunity for Sara the Frier
of Pepper Pods, and splendidly she rode
upon it to renewed fortune. For months
she had eaten the wormwood of a dishonoured
oracle. She had told the people that rival
loves dwelt beneath the roof of Casa Di
Bello, and that some day grand trouble would
be the fruit; but as time wore on and the
volcano gave no hint of eruption Sara’s patrons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
flung the prophecy in her teeth and
bought their fried pepper pods of an upstart
competitor from the Porta del Carmine of
Naples. Now she was able to brush the
under side of her chin with the back of her
hand when the aforetime scoffers passed, and
ask triumphantly, “Who was it, my stupid
one, that foretold grand trouble in Casa Di
Bello?” No longer could her soothsaying
power be doubted, and the morning after the
letting of Signor Di Bello’s blood many an
old customer, eager for news, returned to
Sara’s frying pan, which sizzled all day with
the steady rush of trade. In the singsong
staccato of Avelino she told all and much to
boot of what she knew touching the great
scandal. Who but she had gone to Signor
Di Bello and told him how Bertino had been
seen to kiss the singer, and who but she had
seen the stiletto that her words had caused
to gleam in his eye? “But it was the other
that played the knife,” her listeners would
observe, critically. This was Sara’s cue to
nod her head mysteriously, say “No matter,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>and look wiser than the plaster cast of Dante
that brooded, yellow with age and dusty, in
the window of Signor Sereno the Undertaker.
And no more light could any one
in Mulberry shed on the matter, for Juno
and Bertino had made excellent work of
guarding the secret of their marriage.</p>

<p>Public interest in the episode declined
when, after one day of closure, the shutters
were taken down and business went on as
usual at the Sign of the Wooden Bunch.
A new assistant, to take the place of the
fugitive Bertino, was on hand; so was Signor
Di Bello, who looked not a hair the worse
for the inexpert carving of which he had
been the subject. While the patrons came
and went he sat near the entrance, sprawled
in his low chair, preoccupied, but answering
with a grunt the many inquiries about his
health. The etiquette of Mulberry permits
no closer reference than this to removal
matters. A subject of vast import and demanding
the grocer’s instant attention had
sprouted that morning. It was in a letter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
received from Carolina. He had just
reached a conclusion&mdash;a fact he betokened
by dealing himself a smart slap on the knee&mdash;when
the form of Juno appeared between
him and the sunshine that poured in at the
shop door.</p>

<p>“Welcome, welcome, my angel!” he
cried, springing up, but quickly pulling a
grimace of pain as the wound in the shoulder
gave a twinge. “Ah! what good fortune!
You are here, and so am I. See what kind
of a man is Signor Di Bello! To me a
knife in the shoulder is a trifle. Already I
am well enough to go with you to the
church. Are you ready, <i>mia vita</i>?”</p>

<p>“Wait a few days,” she said, with her
frigid calm, “then I will tell you.”</p>

<p>“<i>Porco Diavolo!</i> Wait, wait! Always
wait. I tell you I can not wait.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“I have my reason.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Ah! <i>carina</i>, don’t you know? Well,
it is because I can not live without you.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>He said it with his upturned eyes pouring
forth a sea of adoration. Still it was only
half the truth. Had he disclosed the other
half he would have told of his sister’s letter
saying that she intended to sail for New
York within a week. His spirit had quaked
at the thought of bringing a wife to Casa
Di Bello when the redoubtable Carolina
should be on the ground, and the conviction
grew upon him that when the moment came
he should not be able to muster the courage
needed for such an enterprise. Wherefore
he resolved to wed Juno and plant her in
Casa Di Bello in advance of Carolina’s re-entrance
upon the scene.</p>

<p>“You have your reason for not waiting,”
she said, impressed not at all by his amatory
demonstration. “Good. I have my reason
for waiting.”</p>

<p>She walked out of the shop without saying
more, leaving him wondering if, after
all, he were going to lose her. As she
made her way through the hordes of Mulberry
she was the target of every eye and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>tongue. Men gazed at her in admiration
and women pelted her with scornful darts,
because of her proud bearing as well as her
coquetry that had set blood against blood.</p>

<p>“A rogue of a woman,” said a brown
daughter of Sicily, fanning the flies from
her naked babe.</p>

<p>“Rather. Who knows what she is or
where she came from?”</p>

<p>To all of this and much more Juno
moved on in haughty disregard. At the
mouth of the Alley of the Moon she was
greeted with profit-receiving deference by
her landlady, Luigia the Garlic Woman,
who handed her a letter. Bertino’s writing!
Seated on the bed in her darkling cubicle
upstairs, she read the missive, which was
postmarked Jamaica, Long Island:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Cara Juno</span>: Did I kill him? Address
Post Office, Jamaica, Long Island.&emsp;&emsp;B.</p></div>

<p>For a moment she sat staring at but
not seeing a gaudy print of the Sistine
Madonna that hung in a faint shaft of light.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>Then she sprang up and hurried down the
narrow staircase to the restaurant. Seated
in the place on the long bench that Signor
Di Bello occupied when Bertino broke up
their little meeting, she called for writing
materials and penned these lines:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Caro Bertino</span>: Your uncle is very low.
Will write soon.&emsp;&emsp;J.</p></div>

<p>As she carried the letter to the red box
on the corner her stoical face gave no token
of satisfaction felt by reason of the simple
but clean solution of a vexed problem which
Bertino’s letter had supplied. Ten minutes
later she stood in the doorway of Signor Di
Bello’s shop.</p>

<p>“Ah, <i>angelo mio</i>, welcome again!” was
his greeting. Then with an air of secrecy:
“But sh&mdash;&mdash;! sh&mdash;&mdash;! Not a word here.
That boy! His ears are very large and his
tongue is long. Every word we said before
he heard. Come, let us go for a promenade.”</p>

<p>They crossed to Paradise Park and
mounted the broad staircase to the pavilion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>where the band plays, and took seats in a
corner apart from the gabbling women and
their swarms of yellow children. Without
ado she came to the point:</p>

<p>“My answer is ready. I will be your
wife.”</p>

<p>“Joy!” he cried. “But it must be at
once. Within the week. The next Feast
of Sunday.”</p>

<p>“The Feast of Sunday.”</p>

<p>“Ah, what a wedding it shall be! The
finest ever seen in Mulberry. Listen, <i>mia
diletta</i>, and I will give you my idea. In an
open carriage, with white and purple plumes
in the horses’ heads, we shall go to the Church
of San Patrizio. Shall it be San Patrizio
or San Loretto? For me San Patrizio is
most agreeable.”</p>

<p>“For me too,” said Juno. “At San
Loretto one finds too many Sicilian pigs.”</p>

<p>“You are right. In the afternoon, then,
you wait in the restaurant of Santa Lucia, all
ready in your white gown and orange blossoms.
Ah, how magnificent you will&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>“Bah!” she interrupted. “White gown
and orange blossoms! Where do you think
I am to get them? Let me tell you something,
signore: I am poor.”</p>

<p>“By the chains of Colombo, then, I am
not!” he exclaimed jubilantly. “You shall
have them, and the finest in all Grand Street.
Here, see what kind of a man your promised
spouse is!”</p>

<p>From an inside pocket of his waistcoat
he drew a large calfskin wallet bound about
many times with stout cord, and took from
the plenteous store therein one ten-dollar
note. This he handed to Juno with a
proud “There my angel.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she said faintly, turning
over the bill.</p>

<p>“And yellow boots you shall have,” he
went on; “just like the ones Signorina
Crotelli had last Sunday. I saw them when
she and Pietro went up the church steps.
Which do you like best, yellow or white
boots?”</p>

<p>“I think yellow boots for a bride are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>very sympathetic,” she answered, folding
the bank note and tying it in a corner of
her handkerchief. And without a moment’s
delay she set off for Grand Street, where
the flower of Mulberry does its shopping.</p>

<p>Two hours afterward, her arms heaped
with bundles, and every cent of the ten dollars
gone, she appeared in the kitchen of her
landlady and shocked her with tidings of
the nuptials so near at hand.</p>

<p>“Body of the Serpent!” remarked the
Garlic Woman. “In the morning you are
a woman without hope, and in the evening
you come back the promised wife of a rich
signore.”</p>

<p>While she shook her head in doubt and
suspicion, Juno spread out many yards of
purple satin, white lace and pink lining, a
wreath of muslin orange blossoms that
should give no poisonous odour, a pair of
white stockings, and&mdash;the sympathetic yellow
boots. As the bent crone gazed at the
finery her zincky visage lost the hard cast
put upon it by a lifetime of penny-splitting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>bargain and sale. A tender light filled her
eye, and she lived again in the sweet days
of her youth. Where was the soldier boy
that her girlish heart loved? Where the
dashing <i>Bersagliere</i> that led her to church
in the mountain village? A great mound
in northern Africa&mdash;the tomb of a whole
regiment&mdash;could answer. Across the mind
of Juno there flashed a thought of her husband
and the crime upon which she was
about to enter, but the next instant it perished
as she snatched up the purple satin to
preserve it from danger, for old Luigia had
stained it with a tear.</p>

<p>They plied their needles early and late,
and when the Feast of Sunday dawned Juno
was ready for the church. All Mulberry
knew of the great event in preparation, and
made high store of attending the ceremony
at the altar; but only the first families of the
Torinesi, Milanesi, and Genovesi, and the
upper lights of the Calabriani, the Siciliani,
and the Napolitani were bidden to the feast
at Casa Di Bello. When Angelica received
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>the command to make ready this feast, she
declared to Signor Di Bello that a malediction
had fallen on the house. To this he
returned only a stout guffaw. It was a terrible
blow to the cook, who was in full accord
with Carolina’s policy of a closed door
to wives. Many months she had longed for
the return of her mistress, lest this very
calamity might betide during her absence.
O poor Signorina Carolina! To come back
just too late to keep out the Napolitana&mdash;the
baggage above all others against whom
she wished to close the door. She knew it,
she knew it! In her dreams she had seen
Juno the Superb queening it over her in
the kitchen, ordering more garlic in this,
more red pepper in that, and making everything
fit only for Neapolitan pigs to eat.
Maria have mercy, but she must obey. So,
taking up her big basket, she had gone forth
to market, with face long and voice doleful,
and poured into the eager ears of Sara the
Frier of Pepper Pods and the group of
raven heads always about her, the story of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>the dreadful rush going on to plant in Casa
Di Bello the woman whom Carolina had
crossed the seas to keep out.</p>

<p>Though a stone of composure in all the
other turns that her adventuring course had
taken, Juno lost her calm a little in the haste
and flurry of constructing the nuptial gown.
As an effect she failed until the last moment
to discharge a duty very needful to the success
of her plans. The oversight did not
occur to her until Sunday afternoon, at the
moment when she was seated in the chair of
Chiara the Hair Comber, receiving the marvellous
wedding <i>coiffure</i> for which that artist
was famous. The hair dressing accomplished,
Juno lost no time in going to the
restaurant and penning these words, taking
great care with the spelling, and making
sure that the address, “Post Office, Jamaica,
Long Island,” should be correct:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Bertino</span>: Your uncle died to-day.
Fly from America. The man-hunters
are after you!&emsp;&emsp;J.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>
<p>Then she put on the gorgeous purple
gown, and called the Garlic Woman to button
the yellow boots. And while the bells
of San Patrizio pealed, and the people,
dressed in their Sunday clothes, moved
toward the church gates, Juno waited&mdash;waited
for the open carriage with its plumed
horses that should bear her to the altar with
Signor Di Bello.</p>

<span class="smaller">FAILURE OF BANCA TOMATO</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> banking house and steamship office
of Signor Tomato had reached the border
of a crisis. Inch by inch the despairing
padrone had seen his well of profit dry up.
No longer did labour contractors come to
him for men, and for more than a year he
had not taken in a <i>soldo</i> of commission on
wages. Even Anselmo the baker, who for
two loyal years had bought a four-dollar
draft on Naples, took his business to an upstart
rival, and people sneered at the sham
packages of Italian currency exposed in the
little window. The slow but ever-crumbling
wreck had left him at last with only the
steamship tickets to cling to; but even this
spar of hope failed one day when a ship of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>the Great Imperial International General
Navigation Company was stabbed to death
off the Banks, and a half dozen of Signor
Tomato’s clients returned to Mulberry minus
their tin pans, mattresses, and other baggage,
but well charged with denunciation of the
agent who sold them the trouble. Thereafter
it would have been as easy to get
home-goers to take passage in a balloon as
to book them for the G. I. I. G. N. C.
line.</p>

<p>Crushing as it was, this disaster might
have been tided over had not a long season
of domestic reverses added to the difficulty.
For three years there had been no christening
party in the tiny parlour back of the nankeen
sail, and during that period the bank’s
advertisement in the <i>Progresso</i> had appeared
without the famous foot line, “Also a baby
will be taken to nurse.” The first families
of Mulberry had always bid high for
Bridget’s offices, and the advent of a new
Tomato had never failed to mark an era of
prosperity in the bank’s history. Bridget’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>vogue was greatest among the Neapolitan
mothers, who do not hold with the American
dairy wife that it is seldom the biggest
kine that yield the richest quarts. But psychological
reasons were not lacking for the
favour in which the rugged Irish woman
was held. In the minds of her patrons was
rooted the conviction that for a child of
Italy, destined to fight out the battle of life
in New York, there could be no better start
than the “inflooence” of a nurse of Bridget’s
race.</p>

<p class="p2b">The brave figure she presented at these
stages! How all Mulberry stood dazzled as
she passed, splendid in the time-honoured
costume of the Neapolitan <i>balia</i>! Tradition
demanded a deep-plaited vesture of blue silk
or crimson satin, which could be hired of any
midwife. Bridget always rejoiced when her
employer said crimson satin, for that was her
favourite as well as Signor Tomato’s. But
there were other points of the outfit that
gave her little delight. These were the
smoothing and shining with pomatum of her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>crow-black hair, and the sweetening of it
with cologne; a gilded comb in her topknot,
and pendent therefrom long broad ribbons
to match her gown; rosettes in her ears, silver
or pearly beads wound in double strings
circling her ample neck; rings galore on
her chubby fingers. And the skirt! Short
enough to show her insteps, white-stockinged
in low-cut shoes. Seen from a distance,
moving not without pride across Paradise
Park, she resembled a huge macaw or
other bird of tropical plumage.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="illo6"><img src="images/i_188.jpg" width="400" alt="Bridget in balia array" title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">Bridget in <i>balia</i> array.</p>

<p class="p2">“Troth, it’s the divvil’s own ghinny I am
now, and no misthake,” she had told herself
more than once when a new engagement
found her in <i>balia</i> array. “Phat they’d be
sayin’ at home to the loikes iv me I don’
knaw, and may I niver hear. Musha, mother
darlint, did y’ iver drame they’d make a daygoe
iv yer colleen Biddy? Niver moind,
it’s an honest pinny I’m layin’ up agin the
rainy day whin there’s not a cint comin’ to
the bank.”</p>

<p>But the rainy days had been too many,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>and the fruits of those golden times were
always eaten up. Since the loss of the Great
Imperial Company’s ship the tide of prejudice
had submerged Signor Tomato. People
would not go to him even to exchange a
ten-lire note for American coin. Public sentiment
vented itself also against the Jack
Tar, that steadfast emblem of the bank’s
steamship connection which had stood at the
door day and night for half a decade. The
hand of juvenile Mulberry had ever been
against the old sailor, but now he was an
infuriating mark, an object of fiercest hatred
to the relatives and friends of the passengers
who lost their tin pans and mattresses.
Passing by, they would draw their knives
and slash at his neck, or thrust the point at
his heart. Every night brought fresh attacks
upon his weather-beaten person with
axes and clubs until the banker found his
silent partner’s occiput lying in the gutter
one morning. This was the last fragment
of the head that he had been losing for
weeks. Signor Tomato took the incident
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>as an omen of blackest import. An hour
later he said to Bridget:</p>

<p>“Guess ees-a come de end-a now. Doan’
know what ees-a goin’ do everybodee. All-a
black, so black. What-a good I am? Tell-a
me dat. Tink I’m better goin’ put myself off
de Bridge. I’m do it, you bet, if I’m not-a
love you and lil Pat and Mike and Biddy.”</p>

<p>“That’ll do ye, now,” said Bridget, putting
her arm around the little man, who
pulled at a black pipe. “That’ll do ye,
Dominick Tomah-toe. Off the Bridge is ut?
Not while yer own wife’s here to kape hould
iv yer coat-tails. Phat’s that sayin’ ye have
about the clouds with the silver insides?
Sure, I know it in Eetalyun when I hear it,
but I can’t say it in English. Phat is it,
annyhow?”</p>

<p>He shook his head gravely. “To-day I
not-a tink of <i>proverbi</i>. My poor wife, you
not-a know how moocha granda troub’ have
your Domenico.”</p>

<p>“Arrah, do I not? Mebbe it’s mesilf
that knows betther than ye. But don’t be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>talkin’ iv the Bridge, Dominick dear, whin
ye have so many iv thim that love ye. Look
at us now, will ye? Here’s mesilf, and”&mdash;she
went to the door and called&mdash;“Pat, Mike,
Biddy! Here to your fatther this minute,
and show him the frinds he has.”</p>

<p>Three tousled black heads and bright
faces came trooping into the bank. Signor
and Signora Tomato caught them up and
covered them with caresses.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, mah?” asked Mike,
the oldest, looking up into his mother’s tearful
eyes.</p>

<p>“Nothin’ at all, Mickey darlint; nothin’
but the warrum weather. Sure yer fatther’s
always downhareted wid the hate, and it’s
mesilf that do be shweatin’ around the eyes.
Away wid yez now; back to yer play, me
jewels, but kape forninst the shop.”</p>

<p>“I can’t play any good,” said Mike
glumly.</p>

<p>“And why not?”</p>

<p>“’Cause Paddy’s got the roller-skate.”</p>

<p>Bridget swallowed the lump in her throat,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>and could not help thinking of the affluent
past when the babies “was comin’,” and there
was a whole pair of roller-skates in the
family.</p>

<p>“Never moind, laddie,” she said, “be a
good bye, and ye’ll have the handle iv the
feather duster to play cat with.”</p>

<p>Mike danced for glee, for here was a joy
hitherto tasted only in dreams. Ever since
its detachment from the worn-out feathers
the handle of the duster had been used as a
rod of correction, often raised in warning
but rarely brought down upon a naughty
Tomato.</p>

<p>“Me want somethin’,” said little Biddy,
an eloquent plea in her big black-walnut
eyes, while Mike made off with the precious
stick.</p>

<p>“Iv coorse ye do, me ruby, and somethin’
foine ye’ll have, be the Lord Alexander!
Here, take ye this, and go beyandt to
Signory Foli and buy the best bit iv wathermelyun
she has on the boord. Moind ye get
it ripe, and tell the signory if she gives ye
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>annything else I’ll be down there and pull
the false wig off her. Away wid ye now,
and come back with the rind.”</p>

<p>She had reached in the window and
taken from a very small collection of coins
one cent. Her husband witnessed the act
of rash extravagance without even a look of
reproach, which argued that the crisis in the
bank’s affairs had driven him to an unwonted
mood. Presently Biddy bounded into the
room bearing a thin watermelon rind on
which scarcely a trace of the red remained.
Bridget took it, and while her offspring stood
as though used to the treatment, rubbed it
over her face with loving care, thus affirming
the Neapolitan tenet that the watermelon is
thrice blessed among fruits, for with it one
eats, drinks, and washes the face. The maternal
apron applied as a towel, Biddy broke
away and made for Paradise Park, where she
was soon romping with other tangle-haired
youngsters around the band stand.</p>

<p>After a brief silence, during which Pat
had shot by the door on the roller skate,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>Signor Tomato remarked, jerking his thumb
toward the headless Jack Tar:</p>

<p>“To-day I am feel lik-a him&mdash;no head,
no northeen. For God sague, me, I’m go
crezzy.”</p>

<p>“Bad luck to the hoodoo, annyhow,” said
Bridget, shaking her red fist at the mutilated
relic of a once noble though wooden manhood.
“It’s the Jonah iv a sailor y’are iver
since we bought ye from the Dootchman,
sorra the day. Phat am I at all at all, that I
didn’t take the axe t’ye long ago? Be the
powers, it’s not too late yit, and I’ll do it this
minute. Betther the day betther the deed,
for there’s not a shtick in the house agin the
fire for the dinner soup.”</p>

<p>In rough-and-tumble wrestling fashion
she seized the sailor, laid him low, and
dragged him over the curb to the roadway.
Then she bustled into the bank, and quickly
reappeared armed with a rusty axe of long
handle. And while Signor Tomato looked
on, his face a picture of rising doubt and fluttering
hope, and passing women set down
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>loaded baskets from their heads to gaze in
voluble wonder, Bridget brought the Jack
Tar’s long-suffering career to an ignoble end.</p>

<p>“Mike, Pat, Biddy!” she cried, resting
on the axe when the task was finished.
“Come you here and carry in the wood.”</p>

<p>She had left no part of the structure intact
save the platform and wheels. These
she kept for Pat to play with. “It’ll do him
for a wagon,” she reflected; “then Mike
can have the shkate all to himsilf.”</p>

<p>The banker’s spirit was utterly broken,
else he would never have permitted without
verbal protest at least this outrage upon his
old silent partner.</p>

<p class="p2b">“Ees-a one old friend no more,” he
mused sadly, looking at his wife and shaking
his head. “I’m don’ know eef-a you do
right.” Then in his native patter he quoted
the Neapolitan saw: “Who breaks pays, but
the fragments are his.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="illo7"><img src="images/i_196.jpg" width="400" alt="Jack Tar’s ignoble end" title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">Jack Tar’s ignoble end.</p>

<p class="p2">“Glory be!” shouted Bridget. “Sure
ye’re betther already. It’s the furst provairb
I’m afther havin’ from yer this day. Arrah,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>don’t bother about that owld divvil iv a
wooden man. No friend iv the family was
he, Dominick dear, and it’s mesilf that knows
it. Not a sup iv good luck had we from him
in the five year he stood forninst the dure.
Wisht now, lave us look for betther toimes
now that his bones bes blazin’ under the
black pot.”</p>

<p>Scarcely had she finished speaking when
the postman stepped up and put a letter in
Signor Tomato’s hand&mdash;a message that heralded
an instant change of fortunes. The
banker’s eyes bulged and he grew more and
more excited as he read. “Phat is it, annyhow?”
asked Bridget, but he was too absorbed
to answer. Not till he had come to
the end did he tell her the contents. The
letter bore the postmark of Jamaica, Long
Island, and was dated two days after Bertino’s
flight and a week before the day set for the
wedding of Juno and Signor Di Bello:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Eminent Signor Tomato</span>: You remember
what I told you touching the bust
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>of the Presidentessa. Well, it is still in
Dogana [customhouse]. I send another
letter in this, the letter of my friend the
sculptor. Oh, I am so sorry! On his letter
I have written that they shall give it to you.
This will make them give it to you if you
want it. I can not pay the tax, and my
friend must not wait so long for nothing,
because I think it will be a long time before
I shall take it, and I have so much trouble,
such grand disturbances. He is as fine a
sculptor as any in Italy, my word of honour.
Now, you take the bust from Dogana and
you make money with it, to become his agent
in America, like I intended. You do right
by my friend and you will not lose. He
will make more busts and you can sell them.
He is Armando Corrini, of Cardinali, province
of Genoa. If you do not reclaim the
bust from Dogana, write it to him, because
I will not write again to you, and
neither you nor any one else will know
where I am.</p>

<p class="right2"><span class="smcap">Bertino Manconi.</span></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>“<i>Bravissimo!</i>” cried Signor Tomato,
the grand possibilities of the writer’s suggestion
unfolding before his mind. “My dear
wife, I’m blief you right for chop-a de Jack-a
Tar. You know de proverbio: When
ees-a cast out de devil ees-a come down de
angelo.”</p>

<p>“And where’s the angel, I dunno?”
asked Bridget.</p>

<p>“Ah, you no see northeen. Ees here, in
de lettera. Angel ees-a Bertino Manconi.
He send-a good news.”</p>

<p>“Ho-ho! The laddybuck that putt the
knife in his uncle. Sure it’s the furst toime
iver I knew angels carried stilettos.”</p>

<p>“Wha’ differenza dat mague?” Fired
with a new purpose, the banker was himself
again, and spoke with spirit. “Maybe he
goin’ know wha’ he’s about. For me dat
ees-a northeen. Ees-a de statua&mdash;de Presidentessa
I’m tink about. You know wha’
dat ees? Guess-a not. Well, I’m tell-a you.
Ees-a var fine, I’m know. Dees-a Bertino
he ees-a been show me de lettera from de
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>Dogana. It say he moost-a pay one hoon-dred
and forty dollar. Ah, moost-a be
sometheen stupendo. Tink I’m goin’ mague
moocha mun by dees-a statua, and de next-a
one he mague ees de King of Tammany
Hall. How moocha you tink I’m sell-a
him? Ah! fine, fine! De Presidentessa,
maybe I’m sell-a her to de Presidente.
Who know? Guess-a Signor Tomato he
ees-a rich-a mahn, he sell-a so many statua
to de grandi signori of America.”</p>

<p>The more his eager fancy played about
the bust the bigger grew the fortune to
which it seemed the stepping stone. From
its siren lips there flowed a far-off subtile
song, which bade him do and dare, go forth
and possess, and by that token end his long
night of poverty in a glorious dawn of riches.
And with gaining allure came the oft-sung
refrain: “The devil cast out, an angel descends;
the devil cast out, an angel descends.”
Surely it was a fulfilment of that fine proverb,
so wise with the wisdom of Naples’s centuries.
No eye could see, no ear catch, a plainer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>truth. The Jack Tar, devil of bad luck, not
only cast out, but, grace to the strong arm
and inspired axe of Bridget, dead for evermore.
And the bust was the descending
angel. Yes; he would obey the voice of
Heaven’s courier and take the Presidentessa
from the customhouse, though it asked every
<i>soldo</i> in the window. La Presidentessa!
The First Lady of the Land? <i>Dio magnifico!</i>
And to him, Domenico Tomato, had
fallen the matchless honour of presenting
this great work of art to the American
people! Not an hour must be lost. To the
Dogana at once and release the angel of
wealth.</p>

<p>Bridget had the best of reasons for lacking
faith in her husband’s business projects,
so she set her face and tongue stoutly against
this proposed adventure into the field of fine
art. To her bread-and-butter view it meant
a leap into starvation. She knew he could
not meet the customs demand of a hundred
and forty dollars save by paying out every
piece of money that was on exhibition in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>window&mdash;by parting with the bank’s entire
capital. In stirring figures she pictured the
distress and ruin that he was going to court.
But to no purpose. From the outset it was
clear that her Hibernian substance would not
prevail against his Italian shadow. Even
while she begged him for the sake of the
“childer” to desist, he went about gathering
up the money. He untied the sham packages,
and from the top of each picked off the
one real bank note and threw the sheaf of
blank slips under the little counter. Then
into a chamois bag he swept the large heaps
of coppers, the small heap of silver, and the
very few gold coins that were in the collection.
“Who nothing dares, nothing does,”
he quoted grandly, as he pocketed the
money, and made for the door.</p>

<p>“The howly Patrick forgive ye,” said
Bridget, following him to the street. “Ivry
cint betune yer family and the wolf!
Worra, worra, Dominick Tomah-toe, ye’ll
rue this day whin they’re singin’ at yer
wake.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, ees-a better you goin’ shut up,” returned
the banker, in a tone meant to be
gentle and reassuring. “Ees-a whad for you
mague so moocha troub? I’m tell-a you
ees-a better you goin’ shut up. Why?
’Cause you not understand de beautiful art-a.
Good-a by, my dear wife. When I’m com-a
back I’m show you sometheen var fine.”</p>

<p>He went to a rival banker and turned all
his Italian money into American. Then he
borrowed a push-cart and worked his way at
great peril among the trucks and cable cars
to the seat of customs. It took all day to
unwind the red tape that bound the bust,
and the clerks counted it a capital joke to
watch the half-frantic little Italian tearing
from one window to another in search of the
proper authority. Darkness had fallen when,
with the big case on his cart, he pushed into
Mulberry and stopped before the broken
bank. At the door sat Bridget with her
knitting, and Pat, Mike, and Biddy were
romping on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>“Ees-a var heavy de Presidentessa,” he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>said, tapping the box. Bridget sprang up
and lent him the aid of her sinewy arms.
Full of wonder, the children followed them
with their burden into the bank. With a
finger on his lip, Signor Tomato turned the
key in the lock and covered the window so
that outsiders might not look in.</p>

<p>“Ees-a grand secret-a,” he whispered;
“moost-a see nobodee.”</p>

<p>By the dim light of an oil lamp he set
to work with cold chisel and hammer ripping
off the lid of the case. When he had
lifted out the precious one, removed the
wrapping paper from her face, and set her
up on the counter, he stepped back to feast
his eyes.</p>

<p>In the first moment of the awful disillusion,
it seemed to Bridget that her little
man had lost his reason. He had seen portraits
of the President’s wife, and after looking
steadily a moment the desolate truth
darted upon his consciousness that the bust
was not of her. It possessed not a single
point of likeness. To the turn-up nose of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>Juno the sculptor had granted no touch of
poetry, and it stood forth in all the cruel
realism of coldest marble. While the terrified
children clung to their mother’s skirts,
Signor Tomato thrashed about the shop,
beating his temples with loosely closed fists
and crying, “Woe is me, woe is me!” He
would not be comforted, nor could Bridget
quiet him to the degree of telling her the
cause of his mad goings-on until she caught
him by the arm and commanded that he be
a man and tell her his trouble. God had
gone back on him, he said, and the world
had reached its end. To-morrow there would
be no Domenico Tomato.</p>

<p>“Look-a, look-a!” he cried, pointing to
the bust tragically. “Dat-a face! O, for
God sague! Dat ees-a not de Presidentessa!”</p>

<p>“What! It’s not the Furst Lady iv the
Land?”</p>

<p>“No, no; ees-a de last lady, I’m tink.
Ees-a lost evrytheen. <i>Misericordia!</i> What
I’m do now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p>Bridget thought bitterly of the proverb
about the angel descending when the devil
is out, but she had no heart just then to
twit her husband by a sarcastic recital of it,
although the tempter put the words on her
tongue. But she could not hold back an
angry thrust at Bertino, who rose now in
black relief as the author of their present and
greatest trouble. At sound of his betrayer’s
name the banker became calm. He stood
silent a moment, and then, with upraised
fists tightly clinched, swore that Bertino’s
blood should answer. Then he took up
again his wild lamentation, railing against
heaven and earth. He went over the whole
catalogue of his disasters, and closed with
the news to Bridget that for three months
not a nickel of shop rent had been paid.
He had staked his all on the Presidentessa,
and now that she had proved false they had
no place to lay their heads.</p>

<p>Bridget treated herself to a flood of
tears, and the children kept her company.
All at once Signor Tomato stopped wailing,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>and startled her by saying resolutely that
they must all leave Mulberry&mdash;right away,
that very night. His dear wife need give
herself no care as to their destination.
Enough that her loving husband, with an
eye on the trickster Fate, had always kept a
refuge in the country&mdash;a place of shelter for
his family whereof he had never spoken. It
was not far. They could load their household
stuff on the push-cart still at the door,
and be off under cover of the night. In the
sweet country perhaps their fortune would
change. After all, it was good to fly from
Mulberry, out to the free meadows, amid
trees and flowers, where birds sang, and one
could see the big gold moon hanging over
the fields for hours and hours. Some picture
of his fatherland had flashed in his vision,
and Bridget, catching the buoyancy of it,
offered a “Glory be!” for the chain of
events that was to lift her out of “Ghinnytown.”</p>

<p>“Arrah,” said she meditatively, “maybe
it was an angel, afther all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, yes; who knows?” he said in
Neapolitan, and she knew a proverb was
coming: “Chance is the anchor of hope
and the tree of abundance.”</p>

<p>Their poverty brought its blessing in the
fact that they were able to crowd all their
worldly holdings&mdash;not forgetting the bust
and Mike and Pat and Biddy&mdash;into a
single load of the push-cart. The puzzle of
bestowing the children so that they might
be comfortable enough to sleep during the
long journey at hand was a teasing one.
But the Tomatoes were equal to it, though
it called out all the genius for <i>multum in
parvo</i> of which experience had made them
masters. What bedding they owned was
spread on the bottom of the cart, and the
furniture so stacked as to form a low arch,
beneath which the youngsters crept with
shouts of glee. A bed not made up on the
floor had played no part in their happy lives,
and this sally abroad in the darkness and
open air seemed a much better thing than
huddling in the cote back of the nankeen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>sail, where Bridget kept her doves at night.
While the parents moved back and forth,
carrying the remaining odds and ends and
finding a place for them on the cart, anxious
treble voices issued from the load:</p>

<p>“Mah, did yer put in the skate?”</p>

<p>“Don’t fergit der duster handle.”</p>

<p>“Where’s der Jack Tar wagon?”</p>

<p>“Say, Biddy’s gone ter sleep.”</p>

<p>At last Domenico locked the door, and
with Bridget by his side at the shafts, began
the exodus from Mulberry, first stopping to
shake his fist at the scene of his downfall
and observe:</p>

<p>“I’m no dead-a yet, you bet-a!”</p>

<p>“Dead is it?” said Bridget, as she put
her strength to the crossbar. “Sure it’s
yersilf’ll live manny a day to wink at the
undertaker.”</p>

<p>It was smooth going over the asphalt of
Bayard and Mulberry Streets, and silently
the strange caravan trundled along. San
Patrizio tolled a late hour for that quarter
of early-rising toilers&mdash;eleven o’clock&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>the sidewalks, which had swarmed with
buzzing life earlier in the night, now gave
back the echo of but a few heavy footfalls.
From Paradise Park the wooing children of
Italy had departed to their homes, leaving
the benches to all-night lodgers of other
climes. Passing the Caffè Good Appetite,
the Tomatoes were startled by a mighty
chorus of “bravoes” and “vivas,” followed
by the clink of wineglasses. It was Signor
Di Bello and his boon comrades. The merchant
had just announced his betrothal and
coming marriage to Juno.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE LAST LADY UNMASKED</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawn</span> began to show the shapes of
things an hour after the Tomato outfit had
left the environs of Jamaica and struck into a
gravel-strewn byway that followed the Long
Island Railroad. All night the banker and
his faithful helpmeet had pushed the cart
through a country sparsely settled in places,
but always with a good road under the
wheels. Now they had reached the last
stage of their journey, and the little passengers,
who had fallen asleep on the ferryboat
crossing the East River, began to open their
eyes. Mike was first to crawl out from
under the furniture, and Pat and Biddy appeared
soon afterward. They were allowed
to get down and stretch their legs, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>they did by frisking ahead of the cart and
dancing for pure joy at finding themselves
in a new and beautiful world. Never before
had they seen a piece of Nature larger than
the lawn of Paradise. In the delight and
wonder of beholding the gloried east they
almost forgot to be hungry, but did not,
and presently set up a cry for breakfast.
Bridget told them they would have to wait
until the villa was reached, which would be
in a little while, her husband said. Their
route now lay directly over the pipe line of
the Brooklyn aqueduct, the manhole caps
of which projected from the ground at intervals
of a hundred yards. To the north and
east stretched a level countryside, covered
in spots with oaks of scrubby growth.
From the low thicket a quail now and then
blew his shrill whistle, to the deep bewilderment
of the gamins of Mulberry. They
would scamper after the mystery and thrash
the bushes for it, only to hear the piercing
note elsewhere, when the bird had flown
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span></p>

<p>At last Signor Tomato, who had been
peering anxiously into the distance, pointed
ahead and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Be praised de Madonna! Ees-a dere!
ees-a dere! Now ees-a all right evrytheen.”</p>

<p>“Phat’s there?”</p>

<p>“De villa Tomato. Ees-a var fine. You
not see?”</p>

<p>“Upon me sowl I see nothin’ but two
big black things that do look like whales.”</p>

<p>Domenico put on a grin and said:</p>

<p>“Ah, my dear wife, moosta tell you de
trut honesta. I’m been mague lill fun.
Deesa villa she no ees-a joosta der same lika
de housa. Ees-a not mague of wood; but
you wait-a, some time I’m show you how
ees-a nice and cool-a de iron when ees-a
cover wit leaves. Pietro Sardoni he been
liv-a here, and he lik-a var mooch, I’m blief.”</p>

<p>“Phat d’yer mane at all at all? Is it
not a house ye’re takin’ us to, thin? What
is it, annyway? Howly wafer! Pipes!”</p>

<p>They had drawn near enough for her to
distinguish two black iron pipes of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>largest size used for underground conduits.
Though they seemed much smaller from
that distance, each was twelve feet long with
an interior diameter of five feet. They lay
side by side, as they had been left by the
builders of the aqueduct.</p>

<p>“Moosha, moosha,” she went on, but not
relaxing her effort at the shafts, “it’s far
down in the worruld y’are now, Bridget
O’Kelly, and yer father’s own third cousin
coachman to the Lord Mayor iv Dublin!”</p>

<p>“My dear wife, moosta forgive your
husband; ees-a got northeen better. De
proverbio he say: One who is contented
has enough.”</p>

<p>The strip of green that crowned the margin
of the railroad cut was spangled with
bright yellow, and, his eye lighting on it,
Signor Tomato said, by way of a comforting
crumb to Bridget:</p>

<p>“Look! Guess-a we goin’ mague plenta
mon here pickin’ dandelion salad.”</p>

<p>One of the youngsters had heard the
talk about the pipes, and, telling the others,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>all three ran ahead to investigate. After a
peep into one of the huge tubes they came
trooping back in a state of fright.</p>

<p>“Somebody in our pipe, pah!” said Mike.</p>

<p>“A big man; guess he’s dead,” from Pat.</p>

<p>It had never struck Domenico’s fancy
that the water pipes whereon he had counted
for a final refuge might become a château
in Spain because of some rival claimant to
their shelter.</p>

<p>“<i>Gran Dio!</i> More trouble!” he whined,
and bundled through the grass to see for
himself, while Bridget trudged on with the
cart, the children close at her heels. Stooping,
he peered into one of the pipes, rose
again quickly, threw up his arms, brandished
his open hands, bent again, and put his
head into the mouth of the iron cavern.
Then he sprang up and shrieked:</p>

<p>“It is he! By the blood of St. Januarius,
<i>his</i> blood shall pay!”</p>

<p>From the deep pocket of his threadbare
coat he drew a heavy-bladed clasp knife,
jerked it open, and the next instant would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>have tried its steel on the awakened figure
in the pipe but for Bridget, who caught
both his arms from behind and pinioned
them in able style.</p>

<p>“Is it bloody murther yer’d be addin’ to
all the rest, Dominick Tomah-toe,” said
she, tightening her grip, while the little
man struggled and profaned the canonized
host. “Phat the divil’s the manin’ iv it,
annyhow?”</p>

<p>“Let-a go! You hear? Let-a go, I’m
tell-a you! Look in de pipa and you see
ees-a what for. Guess-a you goin’ want kill
too.”</p>

<p>At this point a well-thatched head stuck
out of the pipe, and the drowsy eyes of a
man on his knees looked up wonderingly at
the group of Tomatoes. It was the face of
Bertino Manconi.</p>

<p>“Ah-ha! Now you see what for I’m
go kill. Let-a go, I’m tell-a you!”</p>

<p>“Aisy now, me darlint. No, no; I’ll
not lave you go yit awhile; not till that
ghinny fire in ye has burnt out a bit. Will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>ye give me the knife? Here, lave go iv it&mdash;there
y’are. Now ye can use yer fists in
Donnybrook shtyle, and not a worrud from
Bridget O’Kelly.”</p>

<p>She had captured the knife. Bertino
was on his feet. Tomato moved toward him
with claws outspread.</p>

<p>“See what you have done,” he snarled in
the Naples patter. “Famous joke, <i>neh</i>?
To rob a poor man of his last cent, that you
might have a bust of your <i>amorosa</i>&mdash;some
good-for-naught of a woman! A-h-h! A
famous joke! But you shall pay. Oh,
woman, give me that knife.”</p>

<p>“Phat ails yer fists?”</p>

<p>“You are a fool,” broke out Bertino,
and the banker jumped at him, but did not
strike. “A fool, I say. You talk much
and say nothing. What is it about the
bust? Tell me. Can’t you see I am hungry
to know? What has become of it? Is it a
fine likeness of the Presidentessa?”</p>

<p>“Presidentessa!” sneered the banker, and
Bridget echoed the word in like contempt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span></p>

<p>“Yes. Beautiful, <i>neh</i>?”</p>

<p>The banker waved the back of his hand
beneath his chin in token that he was not
to be fooled. “You are a great innocent.
Yes; but you can’t play off on me.
You know it is not the First Lady of the
Land.”</p>

<p>“Not the Presidentessa?”</p>

<p>“No, you thief!”</p>

<p>“For the love of the bright Saints, who
is it?”</p>

<p>“Bah! You know.”</p>

<p>“I swear I do not. It was a picture of
the Presidentessa that I sent to the sculptor.
Maria! Has Armando made the wrong
woman? Where is it?”</p>

<p>“Here.”</p>

<p>In a jiffy the furniture atop of it was
removed and the boxed marble set on the
ground. When the paper had been torn off
and the face of Juno stood revealed in the
morning’s first flush Bertino was on hands
and knees before it.</p>

<p>“Holy Madonna of Grace!” he shrieked,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>and got up covering his eyes and turning
away. “It is too much, too much!”</p>

<p>“Who is it?” asked Bridget and Domenico
in concert.</p>

<p>“My wife!”</p>

<p>“Arrah, now I know the mug iv it!”
cried Bridget in triumph. “Sure that pug
nose has been dancin’ in me brain like a
nightmare since iver I seen it in the bank.
She’s noane other than the singer I seen in
the Caffè of the Bella Siciliana the day ye
was writin’ at the table. Do ye moind?”</p>

<p>She spoke in Signor Tomato’s jargon,
tinctured freely with dashes of her mother
brogue.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Bertino answered; “it was on
that day she promised to be my wife, and
that day I wrote the letter to Armando and
put in a picture of the First Lady.”</p>

<p>“Be the same token, ye did nothin’ iv
the koind, for it’s mesilf that remimbers seein’
her take out that pictoor when ye ran to
the dure at her biddin’, and putt another wan
in its place. Then it was she putt in her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>own ugly mug and ruined the hull iv us.
Sure anny blind man can see it now wid half
an eye. Worra, worra, why didn’t I know
what it mint at the toime!”</p>

<p>“I will kill her,” Bertino said in a low
voice, and Signor Tomato dropped wearily
on the ground. It was the moment for a
soul-thrilling proverb, but the apt one would
not come, and he eased his feelings with the
poor makeshift, “He who goes slow goes
safe” (<i>Chi va piano va sano</i>).</p>

<p>No impolite questions were put to Bertino
concerning the affair that had necessitated
his sudden exit from Mulberry, nor did
Bertino give any hint of his belief, inspired
by Juno’s ruse, that Signor Di Bello had
been laid low. Had not the ethics of Mulberry
rendered the knife-play and the names
of all concerned a forbidden subject, they
could have told him that his uncle was up
and about and cracking walnuts in his usual
form. But the <i>vendetta</i> is sacred, and
Bridget, itching as she was to discuss the
murderous attempt, was too much Italianized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
to venture upon that hallowed ground.
Aided by their knowledge of Signor Di
Bello’s admiration for Juno, however, the
Tomatoes were easily able to understand
why Bertino had risen to the assertion of
a husband’s rights under the law of the
stiletto.</p>

<p>When Bertino told them he had slept in
the pipe every night since his hasty departure
from the city, the banker, with an expansive
grace that atoned handsomely for
the insult of attempting to slay him, begged
him to remain a guest at Villa Tomato.
They were not quite settled in their summer
home, to be sure, but in a few minutes they
would be prepared to serve breakfast. The
formality ended here, for one and all they
fell to the task of putting their house in order.
First the clamour of Mike, Pat, and
Biddy was silenced by issuing to each a large
chunk of coarse bread, with the command
that they go at once and gather dry twigs
for firewood. The urchins returned quickly
with the stock of bread greatly diminished,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>but the store of firewood not much increased.
Meantime Signor Tomato and
Bertino had set up the stove, and fitted a
sheet-iron chimney to the end of the pipe
that was to serve as kitchen and parlour.
Bridget soon had a fire crackling, though it
tried her back somewhat stooping as she
moved from the parlour door to the kitchen.
But she did not grumble. Her heart
warmed with womanly response to the blessing
of a home, lowly as it was, and she
stirred inside and out of the pipe with a
jollity of temper that bespoke the halcyon
days of the babies.</p>

<p>The Last Lady, as they now called the
wicked bust, had swallowed all but a dollar
or two of the bank’s capital, but for what remained
to give them a new start Bridget was
full of thanksgiving. She had rationed the
outfit with a small supply of codfish, with
which to make the indispensable Neapolitan
<i>baccalà</i>; a generous measure of the cheap
but enduring lupine beans, some bacon, red
onions, and a half dozen loaves of secondhand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
bread. So well had she managed the
finances that a balance of forty-seven cents
was left in the treasury. Soon after the blue
smoke began writhing from the chimney she
had a pot of soup on the stove, and hungrily
Domenico and Bertino busied themselves
in the current of its gustful odour. They
brought leafy boughs from the scrub oaks
and fashioned them thickly atop and beside
both wings of the iron villa to shield it from
the sun’s fire. They made it look like a
mound of the plain grown with tangled
greenery and pierced by two grottoes straight
and smooth as arrow shafts. Of the pipe
not used as a kitchen they devised a dormitory,
and placed therein the Last Lady, first
swathing her tenderly in paper and putting
her back in the casing of pine wood. For
doors the nankeen sail was made to serve a
new turn, but not without a throe of sorrow
did the banker cut it in parts and fasten
them to the ends of the pipes.</p>

<p>The first meal cooked in the villa scullery
was a triumph for Bridget’s art. Never in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>all her Mulberry days had she produced a
better <i>minestrone</i>. Bertino was asked to a
seat at the table, which consisted of a piece
of oilcloth spread on the ground. While
they sat like tailors in a circle spooning their
thick soup from tin plates and munching
the secondhand bread, a bobolink and his
wife, drawn by the human habitation, dashed
above them, weighing the question of becoming
neighbours:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent8">“...Now they rise and now they fly;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They cross and turn, and in and out, and down the middle and wheel about,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With a ’phew, shew, Wodolincon; listen to me, Bobolincon!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At length they dropped in the high
grass not many yards away, and began laying
the foundation for their house, undaunted
by the trio of natural nest burglars
whose wondering eyes and ears had taken
them in. But Mike, Pat, and Biddy never
discovered the pale-blue egg that soon lay
there; and in the days that followed, when
the other Tomatoes and Bertino were afield
gathering dandelion leaves, and Bridget sat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>with her knitting at the kitchen door, the
rollicking song of these trustful neighbours
was often the only sound that enlivened the
desolate moor.</p>

<p>When Saturday morning came, and the
push-cart was heaped high with the esculent
herbs, Signor Tomato said to Bridget:</p>

<p>“Guess ees-a better I’m goin’ to de cit
for sell-a de salata. See how moocha!
Moosta have tree dollar for dat.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Bridget, and away he
started with their first load of produce for
market. Bertino helped him push as far as
Jamaica; then he went to the post office to
inquire for the letter that Juno had promised
to write telling him the result of his
uncle’s wound. There was no letter for
him. He had made up his mind to get
away from America somehow should the
death of Signor Di Bello make him a murderer,
but he thirsted for an accounting with
Juno in the matter of the bust. His wife
had deceived him, and the canons of <i>vendetta</i>
left him only one course. At the same time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>he saw that he was in Juno’s power, and for
the present must do naught to fan her wrath.
She knew his hiding place, and could deliver
him to the man-hunters of the Central Office.
What a simpleton he had been to tell
her! Had his heart not warned him all
along that she did not love him? Well, he
was blind no more. He would wait, and if
his uncle died, Australia or any other land
would do for a refuge, but he would not
quit America until he had collected from
Juno the debt she owed him and the poor
sculptor whom her treachery would be sure
to send to a madhouse.</p>

<p>As he trudged back to the pipes it occurred
to him that there would be fine lyric
justice in a measure of vitriol well thrown
at the face that poor Armando’s marble so
faithfully depicted. But to this form of
payment he quickly said no; smooth, lean
steel, tried and true, was the best friend of
the <i>vendetta</i>.</p>

<p>When Signor Tomato reached Mulberry
the day was spent, and the market minstrels
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>had begun their songs. It was no easy
work for him to find a place at the curbstone
wherein he could squeeze and join
the long line of Saturday-night venders
who filled the air with their ditties. In the
weary solitude of his journey from Jamaica
he had had ample time to plagiarize an ancient
market couplet, so that when he began
to offer his wares he was able to do so in the
manner of a veteran:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Dandelion, tra-la-la, dandelion, tra-la-lee;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Buy him and eat him, and lusty you’ll be!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The people marvelled at beholding the
banker in his new rôle, but they bought of
his stock, and the first venture of Villa Tomato
in the world of commerce was a resplendent
success.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE FALCON SAVES THE DOVE</span></h2></div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Marianna!</span>”</p>

<p>It was the austere voice of Carolina, and
a love scene behind the second-cabin smoking
room came to an abrupt close. Though
it was not the first stolen meeting with Armando
that she had broken up during the
voyage, Carolina had never told the girl that
she must shun other suitors because of a
husband already chosen for her in New
York. Profiting by her experience as a
meddler in the love affairs of others, she
had deemed best to conceal her matrimonial
plans for Casa Di Bello until it should be
too late for Marianna to defy her wishes.
Not until the final day of the passage, therefore,
did she let out the cat. Then she pictured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
to the girl the splendid future prepared
for her as the wife of Signor Di Bello,
the merchant prince of Mulberry.</p>

<p>“But I am promised to Armando,” said
Marianna. “How can I marry any one
else?”</p>

<p>“Bah! A poor devil whom you would
have to feed. You will never see him again.
In America he will soon forget you and find
another <i>amorosa</i>. With my brother for a
husband you will be a signora&mdash;as fine a
lady as any in America. We have many
pigs in Mulberry. With this good-for-naught
sculptor you would soon be one of
them.”</p>

<p>“He is as good as any one else&mdash;even
your brother. Anyhow, I love him.”</p>

<p>The hour had come for Carolina to assert
her power. “Love him!” she snapped.
“What if you do? Will love put meat in
your soup? You are <i>matta</i> [crazy]. Perhaps
I shall find a way to give you reason.
Do you think you would like to be homeless
in that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>The ship was nearing the Battery, and
Carolina pointed toward the New York
shore. With deep satisfaction she perceived
that the girl’s spirit quailed before the awful
vastness of the city. Presently Marianna
caught sight of Armando coming from the
companion way with his poor little valise,
which she knew contained all his worldly
goods. What if she defied her aunt, and
cast her fortunes at once with him? No.
She could not add to his burden. But need
she do so? Could she not rather be a help?
Toil had been ever her lot. She could not
remember when she had not worked away
her days&mdash;until, until Aunt Carolina had
taken her up, had provided her with fine
clothes, and made her live like a signora.
No matter; she would rather be poor and
work for Armando. But New York!
That great monster crouching there in its
Sunday nap, and sending lazy curls of
steaming breath from its thousands of
snouts! It was that they would have to
dare&mdash;to fight that!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span></p>

<p>“You are a ninny to stand there in doubt&mdash;to
think of doing anything but what I
say,” Carolina went on. “See the clothes
I have bought you. Do you know what I
paid in Genova for that dress, that hat, those
shoes? Well, I paid sixty <i>lire</i>, not counting
the buttons and lining. But what can one
expect from a silly girl? I buy you fine
clothes, I bring you to America in second
class like a signora. I offer you a signore
for a husband, with a beautiful house to live
in. But you, the goose, say you like better
to dress in rags, to have a beggar for a husband,
to starve, to live in the streets; for
into the streets you go, remember, if you
continue to play the fool.”</p>

<p>Carolina was no stranger to the lotus
that gives languor of conscience toward
means when the end cries for attainment.
Moreover, her present mood was bordering
desperation. The mishap that laid her low
for so many months had worn off her veneer
of placidity, and she returned to America
much the same galvanic Italian that she was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>the day she first set foot in Castle Garden&mdash;the
Carolina of pre-churchly days, who flared
up and left her brother’s roof after a quarrel
over watermelons, and put herself under
holy orders. Unluckily for her peace of
mind, while she lay a prisoner in the mountains
waiting for broken bones to knit, she
had received advices regularly concerning
affairs at Casa Di Bello&mdash;especially affairs
matrimonial. The letters were in the fine
hand of the public writer of Mulberry,
but the message they bore came from Carolina’s
faithful ally, Angelica. In her zeal to
serve, the cook only added wormwood to
her mistress’s cup of gall, for her missives
always told darkly of some would-be wife
threatening the castle. The last letter had
spoken with maddening vagueness of a crisis
surely at hand, and Carolina’s instinct told
her that the crisis was Juno. For this reason
she had sailed a week before the day
given her brother as the one of her intended
departure. How could she remain supine in
Genoa when Casa Di Bello stood menaced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>with an invasion that meant ruin to her
fond designs? With Juno driven back,
Carolina saw the battle won, for she had no
doubt at all of her power to mould the will
of a lovelorn maid. She was guilefully confident
that there would arise no balk to her
plans through Marianna’s refusal to be
wived by Di Bello, for, with a subtilty deep
set in her nature, she had counted from the
outset, other arguments failing, that she
should persuade the damsel in the end by
the homely device of threatening to turn
her adrift. Wherefore, having begun the
assault, and observing that this line of tactics
had melted Marianna to a thoughtful
silence, she followed it up while they crossed
the ferry from Hoboken, seated in a cab,
their luggage on top. As they rolled over
the cobbles of the lower East Side and the
warm breath of May entered the window,
Carolina gave her picture of a girl homeless
and starving in the big city many a convincing
touch. At Broadway, chance came to
her aid with an object lesson. There was a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>cable-car blockade, and while the cab waited,
a haggard woman, young but aged by vice
and want, put her open hand into the window.
Carolina drove her away with an
angry word and a contemptuous stare.</p>

<p>“You see how one treats beggars in
New York,” she said to Marianna, whose
colour had all gone. “You would be like
that if I shut the door on you. Who do
you think would feed you if I turned you
out?”</p>

<p>Marianna looked upon the strange faces
that passed by, and something she saw there&mdash;or
the lack of something&mdash;in the eyes of
her fellow-beings struck fresh terror to her
soul, and the tears came. “Oh, where is
Armando?” she asked herself, sobbing.
Why had he left the ship without her? It
was all his fault. He should have taken her
with him. He did not love her, and would
not care if she did marry Signor Di Bello.
If they had only stayed in Italy&mdash;in the
mountains, where she had been so happy!
She would have remained if Armando had.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>She knew she would, in <i>spite</i> of Carolina.
But he, too, was a fool. All was lost
now&mdash;their love, their happiness. But for
the bust he would have stayed at home,
perhaps&mdash;yes, it was the bust! Maledictions
upon it and the First Lady of the
Land!</p>

<p>The cab dashed under the roar of an
Elevated train. Carolina lay back in the
seat and regarded her charge complacently,
with drooping eyelids. As they turned into
Mulberry her face was a symbol of smug
content. She felt certain now of a manageable
wife for Casa Di Bello. But the imperious
tug she gave the brass bell handle of
Casa Di Bello sounded the knell of her
vivid hopes. The door opened, and she
looked into the awe-struck face of Angelica.
With difficulty the cook found speech for
the terrible news: Signor Di Bello gone
to church to be married&mdash;and to Juno the
Superb! Yes, yes; the Neapolitan pig!
At that very moment they must be standing
at the altar of San Patrizio! Oh, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>grand feast that awaited them! See, there
was the table all laid! Ah, such wine, such
fruit! All there under the fine white cloth!
Soon they would be back from the church,
and the house would be full of guests eating
and drinking, for he had invited the first
families of the Torinesi, Milanesi, and Genovesi,
besides many swine from the south.
And all for a Neapolitan pig! <i>Santissima
Vergine!</i></p>

<p>Marianna felt that she would like to
throw herself at this pig’s feet and kiss them
in the joy of her deliverance, while Carolina
gave play to her rage in a storm of anathema
against her brother and the singer. In the
thick of her onset&mdash;all rituals of conduct
torn to shreds&mdash;the door bell jingled tragically.
With bated breath, Angelica turned
the knob, and Carolina struck a pose of disdain
in the hallway. As the door opened
a chorus of greetings and happy auguries
came from a group of men and women at
the threshold, all in their sprucest Sunday
array. They were the first lot of invited
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>guests, and would have swarmed in, but
Carolina ordered them back.</p>

<p>“We have come to the wedding feast,”
they protested. “Signor Di Bello has bidden
us.”</p>

<p>“Begone, you ragabash and bobtail!”
said Carolina, and she slammed the door
in their faces.</p>

<span class="smaller">AT THE ALTAR OF SAN PATRIZIO</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Never</span> did wedding barouche so gorgeous
roll over the asphalt of Mulberry as
the one in which Signor Di Bello and his
bride rode to church; and never had the
people beheld such an illustrious couple in
nuptial parade. With an overdone mimicry
of the princesses and duchesses she had
watched so often driving in the Chiaja of
Naples, Juno sat erect and grand of mien,
deigning scarcely a glance to right or left.
Now and then she did smile with a feigned
grace, or bow with mock condescension in
response to some wild salvo of “bravoes”
shot as they passed by a <i>caffè</i> from the
throats of Signor Di Bello’s boon comrades.
Nor did these salutes meet with a less dignified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
return from the bridegroom. His old
friends wondered, and avowed that the bubbling
merchant was not himself to-day.
And, in truth, for the first time in his life
the signore had put on an air of loftiness
and gravity. No one could say that the
radiant creature in purple by his side surpassed
him in grandeur. Perhaps it was the
example of Juno, perhaps the witchery of
his looking-glass. An hour before, arrayed
in evening clothes spick and span from the
tailor, who had worked overtime, Signor
Di Bello had viewed his mirrored self with
much approval and delight. It was his first
dress suit, and the round brow, the bushy
hair, and the King Humbert mustache
showed above the broad field of shirt front
in bolder relief and a light that was new to
their owner. His facial likeness to the
monarch of Italy had ever been a spring of
secret pride, but not until to-day, when he
beheld himself in royal raiment, had the
similitude played him any mental pranks.
Fondly he gazed in the mirror’s verge, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>said to himself: “Ah! that is the head of
the king, and the head is on my shoulders.”
And it was because the king had got into
that head so badly that Signor Di Bello
rode to his wedding with the stateliness of a
royal chief.</p>

<p>At length the plumed steeds turned into
the Sicilian quarter, and the bridal pair
could see the Gothic façade of San Patrizio
a block away. At this stage the march
lost its triumphal flavour. They had entered
the enemy’s country. Here the dusky
women at windows breathed no auguries of
good fortune, and the white-shirted men on
the sidewalk, idling in their Sunday best,
had no “bravo” for the distinguished bridegroom.
For about half the distance the
Genovese and his Neapolitan were permitted
to pass in respect if not in love.
Doubtless this silent show of bad blood
would have continued unbroken till the
church portals were reached, but for the act
of a certain earringed fellow who stood on a
low balcony. In the long ago his eyes had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>seen Humbert, and now he was struck so
hard with the resemblance borne him by the
man in the carriage that, in a voice ringing
sharp to a hundred ears, he shouted:</p>

<p>“Long live the king!” (“<i>Evviva il
re!</i>”)</p>

<p>All within earshot laughed as they saw
the aptness of the gibe, and, while the barouche
moved along slowly, a dozen tongues
by turns re-echoed the cry with derisive
resonance:</p>

<p>“Long live the king!”</p>

<p>It would have been difficult to tell from
the faces of Juno and Signor Di Bello
whether they were pleased or offended.</p>

<p>Among the few who cried out was a
young man in black velveteen coat and flowing
cravat. His pallid face was serious, had
a puzzled look, and <i>his</i> “Long live the
king!” did not smack of mockery. He fell
in beside the carriage, and kept up with it,
though with one hand he lugged a large
valise. Twice he tripped and almost fell in
his effort to follow without taking his eyes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>off Juno. When the carriage stopped he
stood at the curbstone as though enchained,
fascinated by the sight of her, and stared half
in bewilderment as Signor Di Bello with a
grand, knightly grace, helped her to alight.
Then he ran ahead, set down his valise, and
stood at the church door. As they passed in,
his gaze still fixed upon her and his hands
clasped ecstatically, he exclaimed in a voice
that all could hear;</p>

<p>“O beautiful signora! How happy I
am! The marble does not lie!”</p>

<p>“Soul of an ostrich!” gasped Signor Di
Bello, clutching the little silver-tipped horn
against the evil eye which he had added to
his watch chain that morning. “What the
kangaroo does he mean?”</p>

<p>Juno gave no answer. In the vestibule
a mincing sacristan, low of bow and smiling,
came forward to meet the rich merchant and
his bride and conduct them at once to the
altar. Already a frail girl in pink and a
hulking fellow clad in new jeans and
fumbling his hat were at the rail receiving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
a wedlock yoke. In the rear pews sat
other wedding parties, awaiting their turns
at the altar&mdash;solemn-faced brides and listless
grooms, bridesmaids in gayest feather, best
men with red neckties, aged fathers and
mothers half asleep. A stream of opal light
from the clerestory windows fell upon these
waiting groups, touching their coarse faces
with a ghastly hue, but adding a mellow
beauty to their cheap finery. It was an
hour of silent prayer, yet none the less a
season when marrying and giving in marriage
is in full tide at San Patrizio. Save
where the mating couples and their trains
were assembled, every pew contained a row
of bowed heads that were covered with
shawls or gaudy kerchiefs&mdash;the heads of
gaunt-cheeked age whose lips never ceased
moving in prayer, and who looked up at
passers-by with the eyes of a dying dog, side
by side with the gleaming teeth and flashing
eyes of swarthy youth. The hush was
broken when the priest asked the names of
the pairing men and women. Then his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>voice was audible only in the foremost seats.
Wedding parties kept arriving. Always a
sacristan met them at the holy-water font,
and, with a monitory finger on his lips, led
them to a rear pew. These were the commoners
of Mulberry&mdash;the toilers with hod
or sweat-shop needle&mdash;who in funereal soberness
had come to the church on foot. They
could wait. But for Signor Di Bello and
Juno there was no delay. As they passed
up the aisle Juno’s purple satin brushed the
rough-shod feet of women at prayer, prostrate
on the floor. A pew had been reserved
for them on the gospel side. When the
priest caught sight of Signor Di Bello, he
bustled into the sacristy to put on a different
robe. At the same moment the man of
the black velveteen moved up the aisle with
quick, smooth step, and dropped into a pew
on the epistle side, well forward, from which
he could turn and watch Juno. Again he fastened
upon her the stare that never flinched.
For the first time since she had entered
upon her bigamous adventure she felt a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>twinge of misgiving. Who was this fellow
with his big eyes always upon her? Some
friend of Bertino aware that she was already
a wife? The priest beckoned them before
him, and as they approached the velveteen
coat slipped into a seat nearer the communion
rail.</p>

<p>“What is your name?” asked the priest
of the bridegroom.</p>

<p>“Giorgio Di Bello.”</p>

<p>“And yours?” of the bride.</p>

<p>“Juno Castagna.”</p>

<p>“A lie! She is the Presidentessa!” It
was the staring man. His voice, loud and
high pitched, resounded through the church
and brought up every row of bowed heads.
As he spoke the words he arose and left the
pew, and stood close to the three at the
balustrade. “She can not be that,” he
went on, heedless of the priest’s upraised
hands. “She must be the Presidentessa.”</p>

<p>Signor Di Bello seemed ready to fall
upon the intruder, and the sacerdotal hand
restrained him. Two sacristans hurried up
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>the aisle, but without danger to praying
women, for these were all on their feet now.</p>

<p>“The Presidentessa, I tell you&mdash;I that
know so well.” He pointed his finger at
the bride. Juno had winced at first, but
now she understood it all, and knew she
was safe for the present. “Did I not make
every line of that face out of the marble?
Don’t believe it, father. She is the Presidentessa.
Juno! Oh, no, no! Child of the
Mother, not that! Where is the peacock, if
she is Juno?”</p>

<p>By this time the assistants, each holding
an arm, had led Armando to the sacristy, and
closing the door, smothered the last part of
his frantic outburst. The priest went on
with the ceremony, but every bowed head
in the pews had been lifted and every eye
and ear was now alert.</p>

<p>“Giorgio Di Bello, wilt thou take this
woman to be thy wife&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Stop! In the name of the good God,
stop!”</p>

<p>The words were shouted from the rear
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>of the church by Signor Tomato, who hurried
up the aisle, while the three at the altar
stood silent, astounded.</p>

<p>“That woman is already a wife,” the
banker continued, puffing as though he had
had a hard run for it. “I swear it by the
Madonna of Mount Carmel. Her husband
is alive. Only yesterday I saw him,
and you know what the proverb says:
Once a&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Silence!” commanded the priest. “This
is no place for oaths or&mdash;proverbs.”</p>

<p>“Bah!” Signor Di Bello broke out.
“The dog is crazy.”</p>

<p>The priest eyed Juno a moment. “Well,
what do you say, signorina?”</p>

<p>“Don’t believe him, padre,” she answered.
Then, turning to the banker: “Stupid one,
you do not know what you are saying. It
is some other woman.”</p>

<p>The banker chuckled grimly and nodded
his head in mock concurrence. “Ah, yes;
you are right. I do not know you. It was
some other woman. Oh that it had been!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>But alas! it was you&mdash;you, the last lady, and
I, poor wretch, thought you the First Lady&mdash;the
Presidentessa!”</p>

<p>“The Presidentessa again?” said the
priest, bewildered.</p>

<p>“Yes, padre. So it was she tricked us&mdash;me
and her husband. Some other woman!
<i>Anima mia!</i> Does a man forget the face
that has robbed him? In marble I first saw
it, and never has it left me, day or night.
Ah, the trouble, grand trouble it has brought
me! Seven hundred liras! All gone.&mdash;But
you, Signor Di Bello, are rich. You will
pay it back. You will be grateful; for
have I not saved you from this woman?
She has deceived me, she has deceived her
husband; but see, I do not let her deceive
you.”</p>

<p>“Go away and mind your own affairs,”
said Signor Di Bello, pushing the banker
aside. At the same moment the assistants
appeared and would have thrown the second
intruder into the sacristy with the first, but
for the priest. He made a sign for them to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>desist; then he ordered them to drive back
and out of the church the women, girls, and
men who were crowding before the altar.
When at last the doors were closed and the
hubbub without had become a faint murmur,
the priest said:</p>

<p>“You must wait for a week, Signor
Di Bello. Then, if I find that all is well,
you may come back and I will marry you.”</p>

<p>“Bravo!” cried the banker.</p>

<p>“Silence! Come to me Tuesday with
the man you say is this woman’s husband.”</p>

<p>“<i>Si</i>, padre,” said the banker. “I shall
be here.”</p>

<p>Juno took the happening more seriously
than Signor Di Bello did. “What matters it
if two crazy donkeys do wag their tongues?”
he said, on the way down the aisle to the
door. “You are mine, and nothing else
matters. In a week we shall laugh at these
meddlers&mdash;the priest as well.” But Juno
knew that the disclosures which the signore
did not believe meant the collapse of her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>reckless scheme. Plainly the banker and
Bertino had met, and the history of the
bust as well as the secret of their marriage
had come out. And they would meet again
before Bertino should receive her letter
warning him to fly from the imaginary danger.
In a few hours her husband would
know that his uncle not only lived, but had
sought to appropriate his wife. What firebrands
of <i>vendetta</i>! Now it was she who
should have to fly, else feel the temper of
Bertino’s knife. What a blockhead she had
been to put off so long the writing of that
letter! Had she sent it two or three days
ago, he would be far from New York now,
perhaps out of America.</p>

<p>When the doors opened for them to pass
into the street they found the church steps
thronged with the populace of Mulberry.
Word of the doings at the altar had gone
abroad, and the appearance of the brideless
groom and the groomless bride was the signal
for a shower of jeers and derisive greetings.
But the signore mustered a bold
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>front and proved himself worthy of his
royal resemblance.</p>

<p>“We shall go to Casa Di Bello,” he said
as they entered the carriage, “and have the
wedding feast just as though that noodle of
a priest had not refused to marry you. And
why not? It will only be observing the
event a week in advance; for next Sunday
the priest will see that these meddlers have
made a fool of him, and he will be glad to
marry you to Signor Di Bello. Now for
the diversions of the feast of the marriage.”</p>

<p>He threw off the lid of a large pasteboard
box that the driver handed down and took
out a handful of candy beans of many colors,
the size of limas. With them he pelted the
people in front of the church, who put up
their hands for protection, and quickly
returned wishes of good luck, for this hail
of sweets always comes after the church
rites. The people thought they had been
married, after all, which was just the effect
that Signor Di Bello was willing his joke
should have. As they passed the churchyard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
the signore shouted to a man perched
on the wall to let the nuptial birds go.
Next moment there arose three pigeons
with white streamers attached to their legs
to insure their recapture; it is an ill omen
for one to gain its freedom. This was a
Neapolitan rite in reverence of the Madonna
and the Padre Eterno which Juno had
asked for.</p>

<p>They could have turned the corner and
driven one block to Casa Di Bello, whose
dormer windows were visible over the
monuments of the graveyard; but the signore,
determined that the observance should
be in every respect like that for a genuine
wedding, ordered the coachman to make a
tour of Mulberry. Up and down they drove,
he showering the hard and heavy sweets and
receiving noisy felicitations all along the
way. He had dropped his regal bearing
and was all a-smile now. His old comrades
rejoiced to see that he was himself again.</p>

<p>“See what marriage does for one,” remarked
Cavalliere Bruno, the wit of Caffè
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>Good Appetite. “Our comrade goes forth
to the altar like a king, and comes back like
a gentleman.”</p>

<p>But the broad smiles vanished from the
signore’s face when they drew near to Casa
Di Bello. Before the door stood a cab on
whose top lay a trunk of ancient pattern
that he knew too well. On the sidewalk,
gesturing madly, were the leading families of
the Torinesi, the Milanesi, and the Genovesi,
with a scant sprinkling of southern tribes.
They surrounded the barouche and shook
their fists at the occupants. A fine trick,
indeed! A joke, perhaps, but not the joke
of a signore. Ask people to a wedding
feast, and then have the door slammed in
their faces!</p>

<p>“Oh, misery is mine!” groaned Signor
Di Bello, but for a reason more terrible than
the tumult of the barred-out guests. That
trunk on the cab had told him the withering
truth. “She is here,” he whimpered, his
courage all gone, and cold despair leaving
his arms limp at his side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span></p>

<p>“What is amiss?” asked Juno, and the
others stopped their hullabaloo.</p>

<p>“You must go to your lodging,” he said.&mdash;“Coachman,
drive to the Restaurant of
Santa Lucia.&mdash;My friends, the wedding
feast is postponed until next Sunday.”</p>

<p>The carriage wheeled about and dashed
away, leaving the first families aching with
mystification.</p>

<span class="smaller">EVENTS WAIT UPON THE DANDELIONS</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the quiet of the sacristy the priest
listened to the stories of Armando and the
banker, and gained a clear knowledge of
Juno’s fantastic plot to secure a marble portrait
and a rich husband. So true did it all
ring that Father Nicodemo saw no pressing
need to search the records of the city’s
Bureau of Vital Statistics. He told Signor
Tomato it would be enough that he bring
the husband in evidence, and he, the priest,
would see to it that the woman was confronted
with him and the truth drawn from
her own lips. The holy man saw in their
timely interruption an act of Providence
that had saved San Patrizio from being the
scene of a horrid sin. But to Armando the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>situation had nothing to offer of comfort.
The work of his life had come to naught.
The bust that was to make him a high figure
in the American market had been turned
with cruel suddenness to a bit of unvalued
stone. Oh, the mockery of it! Instead of
the First Lady of the Land, he had given
his heart and hand and brain to what?&mdash;the
Last Lady of Mulberry! To the sculptor’s
plaint the banker added his, and the priest,
feeling for them warmly, and knowing no
deed that could help, offered them the anodyne
of words. Fellows in misery, they left
the church together, after Armando had
searched for and recovered the valise that he
had flung down, he knew not where, when
he followed Juno to the altar. Side by side
they walked through Mulberry, exchanging
doleful tales. They were passing before
Casa Di Bello, when Signor Tomato halted
abruptly and said:</p>

<p>“Behold, comrade, the root of all our
woe! She wanted to get into that house.
Bertino has told me all. But Fate has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>beaten her as well as us. ’Twixt the wish
and the prize high mountains arise.”</p>

<p>They stood a moment looking up at the
windows, when the massive door swung
open, and Marianna, clearing the steps at
a bound, threw herself into the arms of
Armando, who, by the lucky chance of
having just set down his burdensome valise,
was ready to receive her with equal
fervour.</p>

<p>“Joy! Grand joy!” she cried. “He
is married, and we are saved.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” said the banker. “I will
go. <i>Addio</i>, my friend; we shall meet
again.”</p>

<p>Muttering a proverb, he made off for the
Caffè of the Three Gardens, where he intended
to put up for the night in order
to be on hand for the early morning market
and dispose of his remaining dandelions.</p>

<p>“Saved?” said Armando in mournful
wonder. “Glory to the Splendid Name, I
have found you&mdash;you are left to me, my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>precious, but all else is lost. You remember
my Juno and the Peacock?”</p>

<p>“The hogs of Genoa had no eyes for its
beauty,” she answered.</p>

<p>“Well, I have made another Juno.”</p>

<p>“<i>Dio!</i> What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“The Presidentessa is a Juno.”</p>

<p>They seated themselves on the top stair
of the stoop, and dolefully Armando went
over the episode at the church. In a voice
that took flights of passion and with gestures
theatric he gave again the cries of “Long live
the king!” that resounded in the Sicilian
quarter, and re-enacted the drama at the altar.
Bitterly he told of his delusion that the
haughty woman in the carriage was the Presidentessa,
and how the spell lasted until the
sacristans broke it by gripping his arms. He
made known to her a secret that the banker
had disclosed to the priest but had guarded
in the presence of Signor Di Bello: Juno’s
husband was Bertino!</p>

<p>So wrapped was Armando in the telling
and Marianna in the listening that neither
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>heard the soft footfall of Aunt Carolina, who
had drawn near and stood at the open door
drinking in the delicious narrative. When
he said that the priest had put off the marriage
for a week so that the banker might
have time to present his proofs she could
repress her exultation no longer. With an
outcry of delight she startled the young
people to their feet.</p>

<p>“Sanctified be the name of Father Nicodemo,
and Maria the Spotless preserve Bertino
forever!”</p>

<p>Marianna and Armando stood abashed
because detected in the crime of being together
on land after all Carolina’s pains to
keep them apart on shipboard. To his
further confusion, she put forth her hand and
bade him enter the house. She would know
more of Signor Tomato, this man who had
Bertino in his keeping. Whither had he
removed the bust? Where was Bertino to
be found? Armando was able to answer
both questions; also to recite the facts
about Bertino’s harmless knife-play upon his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>uncle’s shoulder, his flight from the city, and
the finding of him by the banker asleep in a
water pipe.</p>

<p>While Armando’s message gave Carolina
the elation of promised triumph, it brought
gloom to Marianna. Well the girl read
the soul of her guardian. Surely this
sudden revival of Carolina’s spirits had but
one meaning&mdash;a return to the scheme of
uniting her in marriage with Signor Di
Bello. But the horrid prospect did not
strike so much terror to her soul now, for
there dwelt a sweet assurance in the face of
Armando, who was by her side. He would
stand between her and this nuptial danger.
She felt a strength equal to a firm repulse
of Carolina&mdash;a strength that was lacking
two hours before in that awful drive from
the steamship.</p>

<p>For the first time the gristly heart of
Carolina pulsed almost warmly for Bertino.
Now he stood forth in white light as the
blessed agent who had kept Juno out of that
house&mdash;the knight who had slain the dragon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>of a threatening wife by marrying her. For
once the truth burned into her consciousness
that marriage was a crowning success. Only
one more union&mdash;that of her brother and
Marianna&mdash;and the strife would be over, her
power firmly embedded. She would go to
Bertino at once and lend him the aid he
needed; at the same time she would gratify
her thirst to make sure that all was as Armando
had recounted.</p>

<p>“To-morrow,” Armando said, “I am
going to Jamaica with Signor Tomato. The
signorina could accompany us. Then we
shall see poor Bertino and&mdash;my poor marble.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it shall not prove such a poor
marble,” she said, with a look and nodding
of the head that suggested some future act
of gratitude for the helpful service to her
cause which the bust had rendered. “When
shall you set off for Jamaica?”</p>

<p>“As soon as Signor Tomato has sold out
his dandelions.”</p>

<p>He promised to inform her directly that
urgent purpose should be accomplished and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>attend her on the journey to Jamaica. But
where was Signor Di Bello? A shuddering
dread showed itself in Carolina’s face as she
asked the question, which no one could answer.
Had he gone elsewhere for a priest,
and would he return after all with the singer
and that mob of Calabriani, Siciliani, and
Napolitani pigs?</p>

<p>At that particular moment her brother
was quaffing a glass of his favourite <i>barbera</i>
in the Caffè of the Three Gardens, whither he
had driven to buttress his nerve after setting
down Juno at her lodgings. The ordeal of
facing Carolina and explaining matters was
one that he shrank from meeting without due
consideration and the aid of vinous fortitude.</p>

<p>“Courage, my angel,” he had said, as he
handed Juno from the carriage. “On the
Feast of Sunday next all will be well. Father
Nicodemo will find that he has been the
plaything of idiots, and you shall go with me
to Casa Di Bello.”</p>

<p>Lifting her purple skirts clear of the
sidewalk, and taking care that they did not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>brush the shabby staircase, Juno climbed to
the door of Luigia the Garlic Woman. To
the astonished landlady she observed calmly:</p>

<p>“Signora, I shall need the room for another
week.”</p>

<p>“But how is this? You go to church to
be married, and you return without a husband.
Body of an elephant! Brides did
not so in my day.”</p>

<p>Without making reply Juno went to her
little dark room and, removing the wedding
finery, folded the dress with great care, put
it in the trunk, with the yellow boots on
top, and closed the lid.</p>

<p>“Maybe I shall need them, after all,” she
told herself.</p>

<p>The recollection that her trump card had
not been played gave back her hope of yet
entering Casa Di Bello.</p>

<p>The presence of Signor Di Bello, alone
and long of face, at the Three Gardens
brought upon his head a rain of banter from
a dozen boon comrades. When the storm
of gibes and rib-tickling surmises as to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>cause of his wifeless state had reached its
height the form of the banker darkened the
door. Signor Di Bello jumped to his feet,
and, taking the middle of the smoky room,
brandished his finger dramatically at the newcomer.</p>

<p>“There, signori!” he cried, bulging with
fury, “there is the dog that barked away my
bride! A meddler, a numskull! He comes
from Satan knows where with a cock-and-bull
tale about somebody&mdash;Heaven knows
whom&mdash;somebody who is the husband of
my promised bride. A simpleton of a
priest swallows his story like a forkful of
spaghetti, and, presto! my wedding is put
off for a week! By the Egg of Columbus,
a fine team of donkeys!”</p>

<p>“<i>Infame! infame!</i>” came from the men
at the tables, which resounded with the
blows of their horny fists.</p>

<p>Bridget would have been proud of her
Tomato could she have seen him at this
crucial moment. Fine was the scorn with
which he looked from face to face, and,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>smiling in imperial contempt of the whole
company, dropped into a chair.</p>

<p>“There is a proverb, signori,” he said,
“which comes to me at this moment:
Some men heave a sigh when the sun
shows his eye.”</p>

<p>“Bah!” roared Signor Di Bello. “Did
I not tell you, my friends, that his head is
filled with <i>polenta</i>?” (corn-meal mush.)</p>

<p>“And yours has not even <i>polenta</i> in it!”
retorted the banker, rising and clapping his
hands close to Signor Di Bello’s face. “If
it were not empty, do you know what you
would do? You would thank me for what
I have done to-day. Would you have me
tell the name of this husband whom nobody
knows, who comes from Satan knows where?
Would you?”</p>

<p>“The name! The name!” from Signor
Di Bello and the others.</p>

<p>“Well, his name is Bertino Manconi.
Do you know him? No? I will tell you:
he is your nephew. He comes from Genoa.
Do you know where that is? He once put
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>a knife into your shoulder because he caught
you playing the fool with his wife. Do you
remember that?”</p>

<p>“Where is Bertino?” asked Signor Di
Bello, his voice grave and husky, every
other tongue in the room silenced.</p>

<p>“At my villa in the country. To-morrow
you shall see him if you come with me.”</p>

<p>“I will go with you.”</p>

<p>“Very good. When my dandelions are
sold out I shall be at your disposal.”</p>

<p>It was long past the dinner hour when
Aunt Carolina heard the sound of her
brother’s latch-key in the lock. She was
in the hall when he entered. He did not
feign surprise at seeing her. They embraced,
and kissed each other on both
cheeks.</p>

<p>“You are home a week before I expected
you,” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes; I could not leave you alone any
longer. Ah! my dear brother, San Giorgio
has watched over us this day.”</p>

<p>“Why?” he asked, though aware that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>she, like all Mulberry, knew of his disappointment,
and meant his deliverance from
Juno.</p>

<p>Carolina answered, pointing to the untouched
wedding feast: “We have many
sweets that will not keep. They will be of
use to Father Nicodemo for his poor.”</p>

<p>She could not resist sounding a stealthy
note of triumph. A few hours before he
would have answered, “The sweets will keep
a week, and then I shall need them for my
wedding feast.” But since the bout with
Tomato his hope had waned steadily, just
as the conviction had grown stronger that
the banker’s case against Juno would be
proved. Morose of spirit he sought his bed,
sighing as he reflected how ruthlessly the
events of the day had shattered his long-fondled
dreams.</p>

<span class="smaller">A HOUSE DIVIDED</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">A train</span> for Jamaica next morning carried
four anxious souls from Mulberry. In
one car were Signori Di Bello and Tomato,
in another Carolina and Armando. The
banker had agreed to meet Armando at the
country station; but the sculptor had given
no hint that he would have Carolina in company,
nor did either of the latter dream of
finding Signor Di Bello with the banker.
They all met on the station platform. At
sight of Carolina her brother divined her
state of mind. He knew that her presence
meant the first advance of a revived era of
meddling in his love affairs, and with the perversity
of the ripe-aged swain he resented it
as stoutly as though his own judgment about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>woman had not just been caught soundly
napping.</p>

<p>“You have come to see the husband of
your brother’s bride, I suppose,” he said.
“You are glad to be near to see me made a
fool of, <i>neh</i>?”</p>

<p>“No,” she answered; “I seek only the
proofs that Casa Di Bello is not to be disgraced.”</p>

<p>They climbed into a creaky, swaying
stage that the banker hired to convey them
to the iron villa.</p>

<p>“It was you that said she was the Presidentessa,”
broke out the signore, eying Armando
on the opposite seat. “What the
porcupine did you mean?”</p>

<p>As the decrepit stage squeaked through
the village, plunging and tossing on its feeble
springs like a boat in a choppy sea, Armando
gave the history of the Last Lady&mdash;the
jugglery of the photographs, of which
the banker had told him; his months of fruitless
toil on the second Juno following a year
lost on the first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, signore,” he added, yielding to a
blank sense of desolation, “surely the evil
eye has fallen upon me and I am doomed
to fiasco.”</p>

<p>“Body of a rhinoceros!” was Signor Di
Bello’s first comment. Then he added, after
an apparent mental struggle with the stubborn
truth: “Yes; she has made grand
trouble for you, but you shall not suffer. I
will buy your Juno and the Peacock and&mdash;the
other Juno, if only to smash it in a thousand
pieces!”</p>

<p>“Will you pay me back the Dogana,
signore?” put in the banker, striking the hot
iron. “I too have been ruined by the Last
Lady.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, signore; you are old enough
to know better.”</p>

<p>“And so are you,” chirped Tomato,
whereat Signor Di Bello held his tongue.</p>

<p>They had left the village street behind
and were tottering over a rude wagon trail
that threaded the thicket of dwarf oaks on
whose margin crouched the dwelling of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>Tomatoes. The site of the iron villa was
not far distant, and from its kitchen chimney
a spiral of ascending smoke showed plainly
in the sunlight that bathed the flat landscape.
From the railroad cut the muffled
roar of a passing train lent a basso undertone
to the squeak and clack of the voluble
stage. At length they struck into the road
that borders the railway, and the banker
leaned out of the vehicle and peered ahead,
wondering if all were well with Bridget and
the youngsters. As he drew nearer, the
deeper became a look of horror that had
come upon his face.</p>

<p>“<i>Diavolo!</i>” he exclaimed at last. “A
new calamity!”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Half of my house is gone.”</p>

<p>One woe-begone pipe was all that he
could see of the imposing double-tubed villa
that reclined there so proudly two days
before. Stripped of the foliage that had
shielded it and its mate from the burning
sun, it loomed black in ominous nakedness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span></p>

<p>Had further evidence of disaster been
needful, the countenance of Bridget would
have supplied it abundantly. Like a feminine
Marius, she sat amid the ruins of the
Tomato Carthage. Strewn about her in wild
disorder were the twigs of oak that had been
so carefully fashioned over the pipes, mingled
with the bedclothes and boxes that had
furnished the interior of the dormitory.
The little garden of tomato plants that had
been set out at the back doors bore the
vandal marks of hobnailed boots and was
slashed with the tracks of heavy wheels.</p>

<p>“Where’s the other pipe?” shrieked
the banker before the stage came to a
stop.</p>

<p>“Howly shamrock, Domenico, is it yersilf?
Sure I thought they was comin’ for
the rest iv the house. Where aire ye these
two days, and the worruld comin’ to an ind
all around us?”</p>

<p>“No ees-a maka differenza where I’m
goin’ be,” he said, jumping down, followed
by Signor Di Bello, Carolina, and Armando.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
“I ask-a you where ees-a de oder
pipa?”</p>

<p>“Ax the divvil and he’ll tell yer betther,
for the ground has opened and shwalleyed
it.”</p>

<p>There was a chorus of whoops at the
edge of the brush, and the trio of juvenile
Tomatoes came trooping toward their father.</p>

<p>“What-a kind talk you call-a dees-a?”
he said, glaring at Bridget and pushing away
the children fiercely. “I ask-a you, where
ees-a de pipa?”</p>

<p>“And I answer that I don’t knaw, Dominick
Tomah-toe! Me and the childer was
away beyandt there, pickin’ dandelie-yuns,
d’ye moind! Be the sun, I’m thinkin’ we
was gone two hours. Well, whin we got
back only the wan pipe was there, and a
cushibaloo made iv the place as ye see it
now.”</p>

<p>“And Bertino, where ees-a?”</p>

<p>“Gone wid the pipe.”</p>

<p>“Goin’ weet de pipa?” echoed the
others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span></p>

<p>“Didn’t I say it?”</p>

<p>“And de bust-a, ees-a where?” asked
Signor Di Bello.</p>

<p>“Gone wid the pipe.”</p>

<p>“Bravo!” cried the grocer, who saw the
case against Juno crumbling. Locking his
hands behind him, he began to whistle
cheerfully, his eyes on the moving pictures
of the sky.</p>

<p>“Shame to you, my brother!” broke
out Carolina. Then she took the witness
in hand. “When you have seen-a Bertino&mdash;de
last-a time, ees-a when?”</p>

<p>“Airly this mornin’ whin we wint for
the dandelie-yuns, me and the childer here.”</p>

<p>“And he no more coma back?”</p>

<p>“Divvil a hair iv him.”</p>

<p>“Bravo!” again from the grocer, the
last barrier between him and Juno levelled.</p>

<p>“Where he say he go?” asked Carolina.</p>

<p>“Well, mum, if I understud his dog
Italian and his hog English, he said he was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>goin’ to Jamaiky to ax at the post arface
was there a letter from somebody in Mulberry.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Signor Di Bello returned to New York
in high spirits. Whether the proofs of
Juno’s attempted bigamy were and always
had been myths of Tomato’s fancy was not
the question that seemed to him of most
import now. What towered above all else
was the monolithic fact that the proofs were
missing, and Juno might be his, after all.
As the wish gained firmer hold on the
thought, he began to view the doings of the
past two days as moves in a miscarried plot
of his sister’s to cheat him of the woman
who challenged his taste.</p>

<p>In the train he sat apart from Carolina
and Armando and nursed his delight. They
could see that he was gloating over the
events that had cast them into hopeless
gloom. And while they brooded, Signor Di
Bello replanned his wedding. Arrived in
Mulberry, he made straight for the Restaurant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
of Santa Lucia and caroled the triumphant
tidings to Juno.</p>

<p>“Did I not tell you they were a flock of
geese?” he said, passing the bottle of <i>barbera</i>.
“There was no bust, and, of course,
no husband. But there will be a husband
on the Feast of Sunday, my very sympathetic
one,” he cooed.</p>

<p>“Ah! Bertino has received my letter
and fled,” she mused under her fallen eyelids
as she tipped the glass.</p>

<p>That evening Signor Di Bello observed
to Carolina:</p>

<p>“There will be a wedding in this house
next Sunday. The priest will not be the
harebrained Father Nicodemo. I shall invite
many of my Genovese friends, some
Milanesi, some Torinesi, and a few of the
first families of the Calabriani, the Siciliani,
and the Napolitani, for I am a man above
race prejudice.”</p>

<p>It was what she had dreaded since the
moment Bridget made known the fact of Bertino’s
melting away. Convinced&mdash;without
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>proof, however&mdash;that Juno was his wife, she
had resolved never to live under a bigamous
roof, though she might, with a wife of her
own selection, endure life in a monogamous
household. Wherefore she would secede
from Casa Di Bello&mdash;embrace again the
rubric peace of the anagamous rectory.
Father Nicodemo had given her repeated
assurance that the latchstring was always
hanging out; that the spaghetti sauces had
never been proper since she left; that they
had despaired of having a palatable dish of
boiled snails fricasseed with pepper pods.</p>

<p>“Very well, my brother,” she returned
frostily; “when that Neapolitan baggage
comes in, I go out.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you will enter the Church again, I
suppose,” he taunted. “Have I not said it
truly&mdash;once a priest always a priest?”</p>

<p>“You will have the police in the house,”
was her last word.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE FEAST OF SPRINGTIDE</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Instead</span> of the arrogant negative that he
had returned to Bertino’s anxious inquiry
day after day, the postmaster of Jamaica
this morning threw out a yellow-enveloped
letter.</p>

<p>“Your uncle died to-day.”</p>

<p>He did not stay to read further, but
thrust the paper into his pocket, fearful that
some one might be looking over his shoulder.
The blind terror of the hunted murderer was
full upon him. At first he moved away
almost on a run, but checked himself suddenly
to a dawdling swing, and put on a
comic air of unconcern. Not until he was
far beyond the town, crossing the brushwood
solitude, did he take out the writing and read
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>Juno’s wily admonition: “Fly from America.
The man-hunters are after you!”</p>

<p>With sharper stride he pressed on, unmindful
whither his course lay if only he
widened the distance between him and the
city. He had walked to the post office
twice a day for a week, and from habit now
he took the wagon track that zigzagged
toward the iron villa. The green bower
forming the roof of that matchless dwelling
rose to view as he turned into the road by
the railway track. A few yards onward the
penetrating whistle of a quail startled him,
and a flash of his affrighted fancy revealed
police rising from ambush on every side and
closing in. For the first time since leaving
the town he turned about, and beheld what
he had not dared look behind for dread of
seeing&mdash;men coming after him. There were
six or seven of them, all in a group, and
gliding along so strangely. <i>Gran Dio!</i> his
wife’s warning had come too late. Why
had she waited until the hounds were fairly
sniffing at his heels? What giants his pursuers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
were! He could see their heads and
shoulders above the quivering foliage. Now
the ears of two horses showed, and the rumble
of wheels reached him. Ah! thus it
was these men could glide after him without
moving their bodies. Courage! Maybe
they were not man-hunters at all. He would
see if they kept on in his track, or turned
the opposite way at the corner. Yes; they
had struck into the road by the railway
and were galloping after him. Idiot that he
was to stand so long! But he would elude
them. He knew the trails and secret hollows
in the bush that would cover his flight
and shelter him until they should give up
the search. What a fool he had been to
run! Now they must know he was the
murderer! On he sped past the iron villa,
not even glancing to see if Bridget and the
children were there. He reached the point
on the edge of the thicket where he intended
to plunge into its shielding labyrinth, but a
look behind told him that this was needless,
for the two-horse truck had come to a halt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>at the villa, and the men were moving about
the pipes, some kneeling and looking in.
The wind bore to him their shouts of laughter
and inarticulate talk. Screened by the
dwarf oaks he crept nearer, until the confusion
of human voices became the dialect of
Sicily.</p>

<p>That the men were all Italians did not
drive away his fear of them. His racial faith
in the sanctity of the <i>vendetta</i> was not blind
enough to make the Genovese trust himself
to the Siciliani, although the knowledge that
they were no emissaries of the Questura of
Police was somewhat of relief.</p>

<p>The gang stripped both pipes of their
green mantle, and tore out the bedding and
soap-box furniture of the dormitory tube.
Full of wonder, Bertino looked on. He
did not know that the letters “D. P. W.”
painted boldly on the truck stood for Department
of Public Works, and that New
York was merely gathering up its half-forgotten
property. In his wrath at this desecration
of the Tomato domicile he would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>have sprung from his concealment and protested,
but the thought that he was a murderer
held him back. He lurked at such
close range now that he recognised two of
the men as residents of Mulberry. One,
the foreman of the gang, he knew for a
distinguished political captain of a Sicilian
election district, and a prominent figure in
the social life of that quarter. So Bertino
dared not show himself even when they
dragged forth the box containing the Last
Lady.</p>

<p>“Beautiful!” said the foreman.</p>

<p>“Beautiful!” was the united echo.</p>

<p>“Listen, Andrea,” the foreman went on,
addressing the other man whom Bertino
knew, “I find this thing on the city’s property,
and I shall keep it. To Mulberry you
will carry it, my friend, for I have a famous
idea for the Feast of Springtide.”</p>

<p>With block and tackle and much hauling
of ropes and singing of hee-hoo! they
loaded the pipe on the truck. Then the
foreman and Andrea lifted on the bust, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>before Bertino’s eyes the Last Lady was abducted.</p>

<p>He did not rise from his covert until the
truck, its big horses straining at the traces
and the wheels glucking under their heavy
burden, had gone a quarter of a mile. Then
he started after it, keeping a safe distance
between himself and the men who might
recognise him at closer range. Only a
vague sense had he at first of the purpose
that impelled him onward; he could not bear
to see his friend’s precious work of months,
upon which he had built his very life hope,
thus carried away without doing something,
and that something, whatever it pleased Fate
to provide, could not be done unless he kept
the bust in sight. Later the clearer design
came to him of following the Last Lady to
her destination, and letting the banker know,
so that he might go forward and reclaim her
from the abductors.</p>

<p>Over dusty roads of the burning plains,
through woodland passes, in village streets,
and on the crazy pavements of Long Island
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>City he kept in her wake. With a feeling
of relief he saw the truck drive into a gateway,
and while he waited to make sure that
she was to lodge there for the night Andrea
came out with a push-cart, and on it the well-known
pine box. Again he took up the
pursuit, which led this time to the ferry
and across to New York. For a moment he
shrank from trailing on through the city,
which his fancy filled with man-hunters peering
into every face to find the murderer of
Signor Di Bello. But an impulse of fidelity
to Armando conquered his fears, and, turning
up his coat collar and drawing his soft
hat over his eyes, he went on, dogging the
push-cart in all its fits and starts through the
lighted highways that he was sure teemed
with detectives.</p>

<p>At Bleecker Street and the Bowery Andrea
turned, and with a sinking of courage
Bertino guessed that the Last Lady was
bound for the very heart of Mulberry. Here
every man and woman would know him for
a murderer, and not a doorway or alley that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>would not have a law-hound in its shadow!
But it was too late to falter. If the bust
were lost now he could never again look
Armando in the face. Bah! he knew a trick
that would fool the police. He tied his
gingham handkerchief over his mouth and
struck forth, wholly confident that his disguise
was impenetrable.</p>

<p>Another turn into Elizabeth Street, where
the tribes of Sicily forgather, and Bertino
found himself amid the boisterous throng
in the flare of light and colour that of ages
belong to the Feast of Springtide. The
New World memory of the Sicilians’ agricultural
festival was in the last of its three
days and nights of fantastic gaiety. All the
colony was out of doors. On both sides of
the way the house fronts were lost in a jungle
of American and Italian flags. In drooping
garlands that reached from window to
window across the street, dim-burning lights
in red and purple glasses gave the barbaric
scene a strange, sombre note. Men as dark
as Parsees, and their women decked with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>paper flowers, and little girls in white frocks
crowned with real and make-believe blossoms,
stood about, each bearing a lighted
candle, waiting eagerly to march in the procession
that would go singing through Mulberry.
Here and there, apart from the gabbling
collection, was the face of a silent, pensive
one who looked on at the doings of
these wage slaves of the sweat-shop, building
scaffold, river tunnel. Did he see a thorn
on the rose of their festivity&mdash;a plaintive
satire of Fate in this clinging to the poetic
shadows of their native vineyard and field
after the substance had been despised and
forsaken?</p>

<p class="p2b">The foreman had come to town by rail,
swelling with the political significance of his
find in the pipe. First he sounded a few
comrades in the wine-shop, and their approving
“bravoes” told him that his idea for a
queen of the feast would hit the bull’s-eye of
public opinion. Then with inflated chest he
proclaimed that he, the leader of the election
district, had not only an idea but its marble
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>embodiment as well. Yes, a beautiful bust,
the masterpiece of a renowned sculptor, who
had been induced, at vast expense to him,
the leader of the election district, to do this
high honour to the brave Sicilian voters.
From tongue to tongue the news flew, and
when Andrea appeared with his push-cart
the expectant people, to whom symbolism
were ever precious, shouted a delighted welcome
all along the line.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 612px;">

<p class="caption">The Last Lady as Queen of the Feast.</p>

<p class="p2">“Long live the Queen of Springtide!”</p>

<p>By the time the procession was ready to
start, the Last Lady had been lifted out and
set upon a flower-strewn throne made of a
large packing-case that rested on the push-cart.
Then a crown of tinsel, typing the
sovereign power of the season over bread
and wine, was lowered from the wire whereon
it had hung above the middle of the
street&mdash;somewhat oversized for the brow of
her stony majesty, but held in place by a padding
of paper roses. The brass band blared,
and the pageant advanced, to the cock-a-hoop
strain of Italy’s national quickstep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span></p>

<p>Bertino had looked on silently during the
metamorphosis of the bust, and when the
long column of candle-bearers moved he
kept abreast of the head. At length they
wheeled into Mulberry Street and passed by
Casa Di Bello. He had expected to see his
uncle’s home in darkness and crape on the
door. But the windows showed light, and,
standing on the stoop to see the procession,
like all the populace of Mulberry, were
Aunt Carolina and&mdash;he pushed the hat from
his brow at the risk of liberty and life, to
make sure that his eyes did not beguile him&mdash;yes,
Marianna and Armando! All in
America! What did it mean? Surely this
was no house of mourning. And these jeers
of the paraders, who jerked their thumbs at
Casa Di Bello:</p>

<p>“A bridegroom without a bride!”</p>

<p>“Ha! Signor Di Bello must hunt another
wife!”</p>

<p>“He’d better ask her first if she has a
husband!”</p>

<p>“The stable of the Genovese donkey!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span></p>

<p>No, no; even these Sicilian pigs could
not be making game of a dead man. Pulling
the handkerchief from his mouth, he dashed
across the street, breaking through the ranks
and exploding a volley of hisses and wrathful
epithets from marchers and bystanders.</p>

<p>“Aunt Carolina! Marianna! Armando!”</p>

<p>“Bertino!”</p>

<p>They all tried to hug and kiss him at
once.</p>

<p>“Are you Juno’s husband?” were the
first coherent words.</p>

<p>“Yes; miserable that I am!”</p>

<p>“Bravo!” exulted Carolina. “The Napolitana
shall not enter.”</p>

<p>“And my uncle? He lives?”</p>

<p>“Lives! By the mass! He is too much
alive.”</p>

<p>“<i>Grazie a Dio!</i> I thought I had killed
him. She told me he was dead; to fly, that
the police were after me.” The others did
not understand just then.</p>

<p>“And the bust?” breathed Armando.</p>

<p>“It is here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span></p>

<p>The band had relapsed into silence, and
the air was filled with the drone of a weird
island chant that lacked only the tom-tom to
perfect its Hindu cadence. The lips of the
marchers scarcely moved as they gave forth
their hymn of praise to the Genius of Spring.
And there was the Queen, wabbling along
in her push-cart chariot, the idol of Mulberry’s
rabble&mdash;the “Presidentessa” whom
her creator had dreamed&mdash;oh, so trustfully!&mdash;to
see enthroned upon a porphyry pedestal
in the White House, admired of the rich and
great. Armando would have dived into the
<i>cortège</i>, pushed aside the candle-bearers who
guarded the Queen, and striven to reclaim
his own, but the grip of Carolina’s hands on
his arm held him back. She had guessed
his death-courting purpose. A picture of
knife-blades gleaming in the candlelight
flashed in her mind, and she put all her
strength in her grasp.</p>

<p>“Let go!” he cried, tugging hard, but
Bertino clutched his other arm at the command
of Carolina. “Magnificent God!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>Am I to stand here and see them carry it
away?”</p>

<p>“Fool!” said Carolina. “Do you think
they will let you take their Queen? A hundred
knives would stop you.”</p>

<p>He ceased struggling. “But what shall
I do?”</p>

<p>“Patience! Here, Bertino; follow on,
learn whither the Sicilian swine take the
bust, and when their feast is over we shall
demand it.”</p>

<p>Again Bertino took up the trail.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A thunderstorm</span> routed the procession,
sending the candle-bearers helter-skelter into
doorways, covered alleys, under the awnings
of the shops. At the first flash and report
of the sky’s artillery Andrea deserted his
push-cart and its royal occupant. But the
dauntless leader of the election district was
at hand. With heroic calm he lifted the
Queen in his arms and unaided carried her
into the Caffè of the Beautiful Sicilian.
Mulberry had but few men who could do
that&mdash;she was of solid Carrara&mdash;and thoughtful
voters saw in the feat a new mark of his
fitness for political chieftainship. She was
placed on a marble-top table in the corner
and the crown straightened on her spotless
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>brow. All night she held court, and until
the vender songs of the morning market
were heard in the streets. Bottle after bottle
joined the dead men, the rude quips and
quibbles grew noisy, quarrelsome, yet no
man drained a glass without first tipping it
in homage to the snub-nosed damsel whose
hollow eyes stared at every one all the time.</p>

<p>An hour before midnight Bertino and
Armando returned to Casa Di Bello to report
to Carolina the lodging place of the
Last Lady. Hardly had the bell sounded
when the door flew open, and Carolina came
out, finger at lips, with a great air of mystery,
and drawing to the panelled oak behind
her.</p>

<p>“Be off at once!” she said, her voice
fluttering. “Here is money. Go anywhere
to-night&mdash;anywhere out of Mulberry. You,
Bertino, must not come back until&mdash;until I
am ready for you. If she saw you it would
ruin all. Go! Ask no questions. To-morrow
Armando will tell me where you
are, and we shall meet. Away!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span></p>

<p>With puzzled faces and mystified shakes
of the head Armando and Bertino took
themselves off, and Carolina re-entered at
the moment that Signor Di Bello was mounting
the staircase to his bedroom. A few
minutes before he had taunted her with the
failure of her scheme to cheat him of a
wife, and proclaimed again the idiocy of the
priest and all others who asserted that there
was a bust or a husband of Juno. A pretty
show they had made of him. All Mulberry
was laughing. But his time would come.
Next Sunday he would turn the tide, for
she would be his in spite of them all.
Carolina could do as she liked, go or stay;
but a wedding there must and should be,
for that alone could save his good name as
a merchant and a signore.</p>

<p>He had spent a busy night with the
flasks of the Three Gardens along with some
choice comrades of the Genovese, and the
years had told Carolina that with her brother
it was always <i>in vino veritas</i>. Wherefore
she knew that he had spoken naught less
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>than a secret of his heart&mdash;that a wish to
wipe out the stain of ridicule was an added
spur to his determination to marry. And
this knowledge sparked an idea that keyed
her cunning to its highest pitch. Without
an instant’s delay she began to put the idea
into practice. Her first move was to keep
mum about the return of Bertino, although
she had waited up to flaunt in her brother’s
face the news that his bride’s husband would
stand before him in a few minutes. But the
new design that her crafty wits had seized
upon made that petty triumph seem not
worth while&mdash;at least not until the tragic
moment she was preparing. Her next step,
as we have seen, was to get Bertino out of
the way. The corners of her closed mouth
curved in a smile of wily content as she
watched Signor Di Bello going up to his
room in blank ignorance of the little society
drama that was in her head.</p>

<p>“Good night, my dear brother,” she said.
“To-morrow I will begin to make ready for
the wedding.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span></p>

<p>“Good night.”</p>

<p>On the morrow she gave Angelica orders
to prepare a wedding feast that should be
the equal of the one that had gone to Father
Nicodemo’s poor. She ordered her as well
to keep her mouth shut about the turning
up of Bertino, and the same command she
issued to Marianna. Neither the girl nor
the cook was able to fathom the purpose
of Carolina, but Marianna could not shake
off a besetting fear that it boded no good
for her.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was a bright morning, and bright were
the spirits of Signor Di Bello, and springy
his step, as he walked to his shop in Paradise
Park. To his view there was not a speck on
the matrimonial prospect, and he exulted in
the promise of laughing last at those who
were now laughing at him. It was the day
that the proofs were to be presented to
Father Nicodemo, and he chuckled serenely
over the plight that the banker must
be in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span></p>

<p>He had gone less than a block when Armando
rang the bell of Casa Di Bello, and
Marianna, who had been watching for him
eagerly at the window, threw open the door.
Breathlessly she fell to telling him of the
plans for the wedding and her consequent
sense of impending disaster; how Carolina
knew that Juno had one husband, and was
helping her to get another! She had closed
her and Angelica’s lips. What did it all
mean? Something dreadful, she was sure.
If Armando would only take her away.
If&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The interview was cut off by the voice
of Carolina, who appeared with her bonnet
on and took charge of Armando.</p>

<p>“Not a word,” she admonished him,
“about Bertino’s return or his marriage to
that baggage. Mind you do not tell a living
soul. My reasons you will know at the
proper time. Now, lead me to the&mdash;Last
Lady.”</p>

<p>Together they walked to the Caffè of the
Beautiful Sicilian. On the threshold they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>came face to face with the ex-banker. He
was in a fine frenzy of indignation. At daybreak
that morning he had started from
what was left of the iron villa with a push-cart
load of dandelion leaves. After visiting
the rectory and making to Father Nicodemo
the humiliating report that the proofs
had vanished, there had come to his ear
news of the marble Queen of Springtide,
and the talk, current on a thousand tongues,
of her strong resemblance to the Neapolitan
who sang at La Scala, and whom the priest
had refused to marry to Signor Di Bello.
And here was the bust of which he had
been robbed. Oh, the money it had cost
him! One hundred and forty dollars for
duty. Ah! yes; it was the cause of his
ruin. But for that cursed marble he would
be still a signore and one of the influential
bankers of Mulberry. He had demanded
his property, but the foreman would not
surrender it until he had proved his ownership.
What an outrage! But it mattered
not now, for they, Armando and Signorina
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>Di Bello, would be his witnesses. “Who
well does climb is helped in time.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, signore,” remarked Armando;
“this bust does not belong to you.”</p>

<p>“What!” shrieked the banker.</p>

<p>“No; it is mine.”</p>

<p>“Yours?”</p>

<p>“I made it.”</p>

<p>“You made it, eh?” the banker snapped.
“Very good. But who paid for it? Eh,
who paid for it? Answer that. Who paid
the one hundred and forty dollars of Dogana&mdash;you
or I? Give me back the duty money
and you may have the infernal thing! Ugly
yellow snout!”</p>

<p>Now, Carolina had a lively desire to possess
the bust, for she needed it in the avenging
play that she had begun to construct.
Nevertheless, her Italian thrift had not been
swamped by the wave of worldly purpose
that had of late come over her churchly
qualities. To pay the sum Signor Tomato
asked would necessitate an inroad upon her
savings-bank hoard, an act to which she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>nerved herself only in the last resort. So
she exerted the might of her tongue in behalf
of Armando’s claim, holding with primordial
logic that the Last Lady belonged
to the sculptor by divine right of creation.
But the foreman, in his rôle of thief, custodian
of the stolen goods, and judge in equity,
had a homelier code of ethics for his guide.
It took him not a moment to decide. He
awarded the bust to the banker on the
ground that it was in his wife’s possession at
the time of the theft, and must therefore belong
to her husband. It was only the <i>reductio
ad maritum</i> to which all questions are
subject in Mulberry. The upshot was that
in the afternoon Carolina paid the one hundred
and forty dollars.</p>

<p>To Signor Tomato it seemed as if some
fairy wand had touched the world and made
it a garden of joy. Now they might take
away the other pipe any time, and he did not
care. His Bridget and the little Tomatoes
would not be homeless. In his transport
of gladness the rude life about him took on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>a poetic beauty. The fragrance of Sorrentine
orange groves filled the squalid streets;
there was rapturous music in the shrieks of
the parrots on the fire escapes and window
sills; the raucous notes of the hucksters enchanted
his ear. To dear old Mulberry he
could return now and resume his proper
estate of banker and signore. Long live the
day in his thankfulness! Never more would
he quarrel with his lot. Ah! the grand truth
in the proverb, “Blind eyes lose their night
when gold is in sight.” Straightway he went
to the landlord, got the key of the old shop,
and, when darkness had fallen, Bridget and
her brood were eating cabbage soup behind
the nankeen sail in the revivified Banca Tomato.</p>

<p>But the Last Lady was still with them,
to the hearty disgust of Bridget. Not yet
had the hour arrived for Carolina to bring
the bust on the scene, and Signor Tomato,
with many a word and grimace of reluctance,
consented, under an oath of secrecy, to keep
it in his place until the supreme moment.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>Pains were taken that it should not be traced
to its new biding place. Armando had
pushed it away in a cart, taking a round-about
course from the Caffè of the Beautiful
Sicilian to Paradise Park. Thus it happened
that when Signor Di Bello, to whose ears
had come the gossip of a bust that imaged
his lost bride, went to the <i>caffè</i> that morning
to see for himself, the bird had again
flown.</p>

<p>“Bah! Another stupid jest!” he muttered,
and thrashed out of the room amid
the titters of a group of Sicilians.</p>

<p>Soon afterward Juno, an unwonted air
of wide-awake desire about her, entered the
<i>caffè</i> and asked to be shown the Queen of
Springtide. Before Signora Crispina, the
proprietor’s peachblow wife, could answer,
there came from a half dozen throats the
merry chorus:</p>

<p>“Long live the Queen of Springtide!”</p>

<p>“Where is it?” Juno asked.</p>

<p>“She is here, signorina,” said the wit
of the company, rising and tipping his hat.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>“The lifeless Queen has just left us, but her
living Majesty is here.&mdash;It is yourself, beautiful
signorina.”</p>

<p>“Bah! Where is the bust?”</p>

<p>No one could answer. Armando was
unknown in Mulberry, and only three persons&mdash;Carolina,
the banker, and himself&mdash;were
in the secret of his destination when
he pushed away from the <i>caffè</i> with the Last
Lady in the cart. Juno went back to her
lodgings greatly disappointed. A dread had
settled upon her that this marble ghost
would spring up in her path somehow, and
foil her plans, after the manner of all well-ordered
avenging spirits. It had been her
intention, when she hurried to the <i>caffè</i> to
sound the rumour about the bust, to get
Signor Di Bello to buy it and give it to her.
Once in her hands, she would have seen to
it that the thing retired to a safe obscurity.
The bottom of the East River seemed to
her a particularly fit place for Armando’s
masterpiece. She doubted no longer that
the bust had arrived in Mulberry, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>mystery of its whereabouts gave her no
peace.</p>

<p>But it was not so with Signor Di Bello.
To the mind of the grocer, put upon so
hard by recent events, the talk about the
Queen’s resemblance to his lost bride appeared
now as a hoax which had accomplished
its purpose of drawing him to the
<i>caffè</i> only to be laughed at. If not, where
was the bust? Surely he knew his people
too well to misinterpret this latest prank.
He knew. It was the first joke of a practical
turn that any one had dared play on
him since the blunder at the church marked
him for the colony’s ridicule. And he saw
therein a sure omen that flat insult would
quickly succeed the coarse raillery. Before
long women would spit at him in the street
and taunting youngsters tag at his heels.
Others that he knew of had tasted the
strange persecution. But it should not be
his lot, by the tail of Lucifer! On the
Feast of Sunday his marriage must silence
every idle tongue. For then he would cease
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>to be that despised of all creatures, a bridegroom
without a bride.</p>

<p>That his lively taste for Juno’s grace of
person had become second to a desire to
avert the rising gale of mockery, Carolina
understood very well. And upon this change
of his nuptial motive she rested full confidence
of success for her own designs. No
bar to her project showed itself until she
visited Bertino, at the cheap hotel on the
East Side, whither he and Armando had
taken themselves. Then she found that the
leading man of her drama had notions of his
own about his part that would wreck the
plot. He was for killing the feminine villain
before the curtain rose. To her directions
that he keep out of sight until Sunday he
demurred vehemently. How could he wait
so long when the <i>vendetta</i> was boiling in his
veins? His wife had done him a deadly
wrong, and, <i>per Dio!</i> deadly should be the
accounting.</p>

<p>“See the grand trouble she has caused to
me, to my friend, and to poor Marianna!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span></p>

<p>“To Marianna?” she asked, in genuine
wonder. “What wrong has she done her?”</p>

<p>“Were not she and Armando to wed
when his Presidentessa should be sold? A
long time they must wait now. Thundering
heavens! But she shall pay.”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken,” rejoined Carolina,
with a note of authority. “It would have
made no difference to Marianna. She was
not to wed Armando in any case.”</p>

<p>“I know better. Anyway, I shall not
sit here biting my lips until the Feast of
Sunday, and perhaps be cheated of my right.
Who knows when she may fly?”</p>

<p>“No fear of that.”</p>

<p>“No? Why not? I tell you she
knows what to expect from me, and is no
simpleton.” Then he lowered his voice to
a stage whisper, first opening the door and
making sure that there was no listener in
the hall. “Twice I would have killed her,
but once I deceived myself, and the other
time she gammoned me with a lie that
made me try to kill my uncle. Don’t you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>see that I can not wait here while she may
be getting away?”</p>

<p>“I promise you she will not leave Mulberry.
Do you wish to know why? Well,
it is because she thinks you have fled from
America and that she is free to become your
uncle’s wife. Ah! don’t you see the fine
<i>vendetta</i> I am hatching for you? On the
Feast of Sunday you appear and stop the
wedding. The Neapolitan beast is kicked
out of Casa Di Bello. You follow her and&mdash;claim
your rights. Is it not a sweet <i>vendetta</i>?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Bertino after a pause. “I
will wait.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> Carolina had not been blind to
the meaning of the signals flashed by Armando
and Marianna’s eyes whenever the
lovers were together, Bertino’s words stirred
her to the need of taking instant measures

their attachment. To this end she resolved
to keep them apart until the final act of her
private theatricals should be played. Thus
it fell out that on Friday, two days before
the time for Signor Di Bello’s second essay
at a wedding, when Armando called to deliver
a most weighty message to Marianna, he was
met at the door with Carolina’s avowal that
the girl was indisposed. He might have
credited the dreadful news but for a face
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>that he saw at the window as he walked
away, and a pair of hands and lips that were
telegraphing with much energy. “Wait,
and I shall be out,” was the only part of
Marianna’s excited display that he understood.
But it was enough to insure his
waiting a week, had that been necessary.
As it was, she did not come until darkness
had called lights to the <i>caffè</i> windows and
the banks and grocery shops had put up their
shutters.</p>

<p>“It is finished now,” she said, hatless and
breathing hard. “I can never go back to
Casa Di Bello.”</p>

<p>“What matter?” he asked, taking her
hand, and for the first time in many a day
showing a joy and contempt for circumstance
that befitted his years. “Come along.
I have beautiful news. Let us go to the
gardens of Paradise.”</p>

<p>It was the first music night of the season,
and the Park had become a vast <i>potbouilli</i>
of Italy’s children, with a salting from the
Baxter Street Ghetto and a peppering of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>“Chimmies” and “Mamies” from the old
Fourth Ward. Armando and Marianna
made their way through the seething mass
about the band, deaf to the rag-time melody
that filled the sultry air and without eyes
for the gorgeous red coats of the musicians.
He was telling her how from the blackness
of his despair the light of knowledge had
suddenly broken, and how in the bitterness
of his exile he had found the sweet of content.
Far from the band stand, they crowded
on to a bench beside two women with
yellow babies at their breasts, and Armando
continued:</p>

<p>“It was last night, and I was here alone,
with only the stars for companions. All
Mulberry was asleep. First I thought only
of myself, and my heart was heavy. Then
the points of gold in the sky seemed to
whisper&mdash;to whisper of you, my precious.
After that I was happy. Do you know why?
Ah, it was because I had made up my mind.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she repeated eagerly; “you made
up your mind to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span></p>

<p>“Go home.”</p>

<p>“And I?”</p>

<p>“You go with me. There; do you not
see now why I am happy?”</p>

<p>“Madonna-Maria be glorified!” she cried,
and the women by their side exchanged
glances and grunts. “When?”</p>

<p>“By the first ship for Genoa.”</p>

<p>“When is that?”</p>

<p>“Some day next week.”</p>

<p>“Joy!”</p>

<p>“Ah! is it not fine? To go back to
Italy!”</p>

<p>“<i>Si</i>; fine.” She paused a moment pensively,
then asked, “Have you bought the
passage tickets?”</p>

<p>“No; she has not paid me yet for the
bust.”</p>

<p>“Who has not paid you?”</p>

<p>“Signorina Di Bello.”</p>

<p>“How do you know she will give you
any money?”</p>

<p>“Ah! I saw it in her eye. And did she
not say, when I spoke of my poor marble&mdash;did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
she not say that perhaps it would not
prove so poor, after all? Oh, she will pay, I
am sure. How much? Ah! who can tell
that? But surely it will be enough to take
us back to Cardinali, and what more can we
ask? There we shall be happy. No more
shall you go to the mill, for have I not my
house and workshop, and will not Genoa be
glad again to buy my ten-inch Saint Peters?”</p>

<p>“Ah! <i>si</i>. Genoa will be glad. And I?
Shall I not take them to the Gallery of
Cristoforo Colombo and sell them just as
old Daniello did? By my faith, I think I
shall bring home as much silver as ever he
did, and more.”</p>

<p>“<i>Si, si</i>; who would not buy of you,
<i>angelo d’amore</i>?”</p>

<p>He kissed her lips and fair tresses, and
the women with their nurslings left the
bench. Thus, and for hours, the exiles lived
in the new-found bliss of their present while
planning a joyous future. Over the buzz of
the grimy, toil-bound multitude the notes of
the distant band came to them vaguely&mdash;now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
in a fugitive creak, then in a faint rumble
or detached crash.</p>

<p>It was long after the music had died out,
and the people had gone to their tenements,
and the pale eye of night had peeped tardily
over a zigzag line of low roofs, when Marianna
said:</p>

<p>“<i>Dio!</i> So late! She will not let me
in.”</p>

<p>They walked to Casa Di Bello at a smart
pace, and timidly she rang the bell, while
Armando waited not many yards away. Instantly
the door opened, and he saw the
hand of Carolina reach forth, grasp his love
by the shoulder, and jerk her into the house.</p>

<span class="smaller">TWO TROUBLESOME WEDDING GIFTS</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Looking</span> down upon Genoa through the
blue reaches of the upper crests is an Apennine
peak which the people, high and low,
call Our Lady of the Windows. Ever
mantled in snow, and a fit emblem of icy
virtue, she has for ages inspired a negative
chord for that region’s lyres of passion. The
princeling in his hillside palazzo sings of his
dream lady&mdash;always an angel as fervid as the
glacial Madonna is cold; the red waterman,
in his moonlight barcarole, swears his love
would melt that frozen heart. But she bears
no kinship to this chronicle save that Signor
Di Bello, on the afternoon of the pregnant
Feast of Sunday, when all was primed for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>the wedding, thus addressed his sister, who
sat by a front casement:</p>

<p>“Ha! my Lady of the Windows, it is
time to go and fetch my bride.”</p>

<p>Carolina gave back only a silent nod and
a closer pressure of the lips, and he made off
to the Santa Lucia, crowing to himself over
the timely bite of his pleasantry. Hour
after hour she had been at that window
watching for Bertino, ready to spring to the
door and drive him away should he appear
too soon. She was determined that the
play should not be spoiled by the untimely
entrance of her star actor. His cue, as
agreed upon, was the exit of Signor Di
Bello, but the fear had haunted her that his
itching <i>vendetta</i> might make him forget the
book. That danger was past now, and before
his uncle had gone a block, Bertino was
at the door. She bundled him upstairs to
her sanctum, and, turning the key, left him
looking out blankly on the graveyard. “In
a little while I shall call you,” she said, after
explaining gravely that she locked him in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>that his uncle might be kept out. Then she
descended to the street door and waved her
hand, a signal that brought a push-cart out
of a near-by alley, with Armando and the
banker at its shafts. Of course, their load
was the Last Lady, but no eye could see her
face, for Bridget had given her best and only
bed coverlet to veil it. No easy task to lug
the weighty dame upstairs, but they managed
it without mischance, while Carolina stood
by imploring care, and all with an ado of
deepest secrecy. At length the bust was set
up in the back room of the second floor. In
this room the bride and groom were to wait
before going down to the parlour for the
ceremony. A dressing case near the window
answered for a pedestal. In the bright light
that fell upon it the snowy features of Juno
showed bold to the eye, while the mirror
rendered back in softer tone her sturdy neck
and shoulders. With a spotless sheet Carolina
covered the bust, and with the others
left the room and locked the door.</p>

<p>Repeated jangling of the bell and a low
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>drone in the parlour told of arriving guests.
Marianna had been cast for the part of door-opener
and welcomer to the first families.
Armando, in the best attire he could muster,
had only a meditative rôle. Thus far he
had done naught but sit in the parlour and
exchange confident glances with Marianna
whenever she ushered in a distinguished Calabriano,
Siciliano, or Napolitano.</p>

<p>A cab bearing Signor Di Bello and Juno
drew up betimes, and word was passed to
Carolina. Instantly she unlocked the door
that shut in Bertino, and bade him be ready
for her summons. Then she called Marianna
and Armando to the room where the
bust was, leaving Angelica to let in the
bridal pair. Up the staircase they rustled,
Juno first, her skirts held free of the yellow
boots, and Signor Di Bello smiling
after her with a quivering bunch of muslin
roses.</p>

<p>“They are here,” said the guests, craning
their necks and whispering. “No fiasco this
time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span></p>

<p>“This way, signorina,” piped Carolina,
with a spidery smile, stepping aside and
waving her fly into the web.</p>

<p>They entered the room prepared for
them, and Signor Di Bello regarded in wonder
the white shape on the dressing case.
“Soul of a camel!” he cried. “What is
that?”</p>

<p>“A little surprise that we have for the
bride,” answered Carolina, advancing and
raising the window shade. “A wedding present,
in fact. <i>Eccolo!</i>”</p>

<p>She drew off the veil quickly, and the
Last Lady stood revealed in the streaming
sunlight.</p>

<p>“By the Egg of Columbus!”</p>

<p>Every eye turned from the marble Juno
to the Juno of flesh and blood. She had let
fall the counterfeit blossoms that the signore
had just placed in her hand, but gave no
other token of disquiet. A glow of admiration
lit up her face as she gazed steadily at
her double in stone.</p>

<p>“It is really beautiful,” she said calmly,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>moving nearer. “I knew I should look well
in marble.”</p>

<p>She passed one hand behind the bust as
though to judge it by the sense of touch,
but before any one could hinder she lifted it
to the window sill and sent it somersaulting
into the rear court. The crash brought
a score of heads to the lower windows, and
the guests set up a cry that disaster had
again visited the wedding of Signor Di
Bello.</p>

<p>“<i>Infame! infame!</i>” chorused Carolina,
Armando, and Marianna when they looked
out and beheld the Last Lady in a dozen
pieces on the flagstones, while the bridegroom
merely laughed, for it seemed to him
a capital joke.</p>

<p>Juno was quick to follow her prompt
action with suitable words. “You dogs of
Genovese!” she said, sweeping the company
with her flashing eyes. “Do you like the
bust now? Did you think I would stand
still and be made a fool of, or that I would
fall down and weep?” Then, turning to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>Carolina, “And you, Signorina Old Maid,
you are a large piece of stupidity.”</p>

<p>“Ha! You do not like my present!”
said Carolina, ready for the combat. “That
is a grand pity. But, mark you, on her wedding
day a <i>married</i> maid must be suited to
her heart’s full desire. I will give you another
present&mdash;yes, a present that every
married maid must have. Do you guess?
No? How strange!” She went into the
hall and called, “Bertino!” Instantly he
darted in and stood panting before his wife.
“Here is the other present, my married
maid&mdash;your husband!”</p>

<p>At the same moment there arose from
the parlour a tumult of voices, and Angelica
entered and said that the priest had
arrived.</p>

<p>“Are you her husband?” groaned Signor
Di Bello, his hope all gone.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Bertino answered, glaring at
Juno. “She is my wife, the viper! She
put me up to stabbing you, my uncle. She
told me you annoyed her; that she did not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>want you. But she shall pay!” he cried,
waving his hand above his head. “Do you
hear, you Neapolitan thief? You shall pay.
After that to inferno with you, and may
you remain there as long as it takes a crab
to go round the world! <i>Figlia</i> of a priest!
Wolf of&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Stop!” broke in Signor Di Bello. Going
up to Juno, he asked mournfully, “Is
he your husband?”</p>

<p>She answered, tossing her head: “He
says so. Let him prove it.”</p>

<p>Signor Di Bello grasped the other end of
the straw. “Ah, yes; prove it,” he roared,
while Carolina smiled snugly, for she had
looked to it that the properties for this
scene were not lacking.</p>

<p>“You want proof?” asked Bertino.
“Well, it is here.” He drew a marriage certificate
from his pocket.</p>

<p>Signor Di Bello seized the document
and cast his eye over it. The disorder
below had redoubled, and with the noisy
demands for the bride and groom were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>mingled derisive shouts of “Long live the
Genovese bachelor!” and “Another fiasco!”</p>

<p>“Soul of the moon! It is true!”
breathed Di Bello, crunching the paper in
style theatrical.</p>

<p>“Bah!” returned Juno, moving near to
him and putting her hand on his arm.
“You believe that?”</p>

<p>“Believe me, then, signori,” spoke up a
strange voice, in grammatical but English-bred
Italian. It was the priest from over
the border of Mulberry, who had come upstairs
to learn the reason of the delay and
heard the last few lines of the dialogue&mdash;the
priest whom Signor Di Bello had engaged
because he would not meddle. Turning to
Juno he continued: “I had the honour,
signora, of marrying you to this man.”</p>

<p>“<i>Padre!</i>” exclaimed Bertino, who knew
him at once for the clergyman he had sought
out so hurriedly at the rectory in Second
Avenue that day when, to outwit his uncle&mdash;black
the hour!&mdash;he had taken Juno to wife.</p>

<p>“I know him not,” said Juno, turning to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>Signor Di Bello, who had dropped into a
chair. But her game of bluff was lost. “Go!”
the grocer said to her, pointing to the door.</p>

<p>She moved to the threshold, turned
about, spat into the room, and said, “May
you all die cross-eyed!”&mdash;a Neapolitan figure
that means “Be hanged to you!” since
the gallows bird squints when the noose
tightens. Then she rustled downstairs,
mindful of her purple skirts. Bertino would
have been at her heels but for Carolina, who
caught his arm.</p>

<p>“Wait,” she whispered. “This is not
the time or place.”</p>

<p>“No matter!” he cried, shaking off her
hold. “She shall pay, she shall pay!”</p>

<p>The sight of Juno’s yellow boots on the
staircase served to quiet the troubled parlour
for a brief moment, the people thinking that
the bride and groom were coming at last.
But she had seen the stiletto in her husband’s
eye, and was out of the door, into the
waiting coupé, and driving off at high speed
before the first families had wholly grasped
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>the scandalous fact. Next moment there
was another flying exit, and Bertino went
tearing after the carriage. This was the signal
for unheard-of insults to Casa Di Bello.
The men set up a sirocco of hisses, and the
women shouted mock bravoes for the twice-brideless
groom. During the uproar Alessandro
the Macaroni Presser led a push-and-grab
attack on a side table heaped with the
kaleidoscopic dainties with which Mulberry
loves to tickle its eye as well as its gullet.</p>

<p>“<i>Dio tremendo!</i>” whimpered Signor Di
Bello, the tumult downstairs assailing his
ears. “What a disgrace! what a disgrace!”</p>

<p>It was Carolina’s cue, and she snapped it
up. In a few quick words she unmasked
the marital climax her drama was meant to
produce.</p>

<p>“Disgrace?” she said. “What need of
disgrace, my brother? Are not the guests
here, is the feast not waiting, also the priest,
and the bride ready?”</p>

<p>“The bride?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and one that is worth a hundred&mdash;nay,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
a thousand&mdash;of the baggage that you
have lost; the bride that I have brought you
all the way from Cardinali. Hear those
cattle below, how they bellow and stamp on
your name! But my bride can shut their
ugly mouths. Here is the young and sympathetic
Marianna.”</p>

<p>She turned slightly and beckoned Marianna
to her side, but the girl remained where
she was, hand in hand with Armando.</p>

<p>“No, no,” said Marianna, recoiling.</p>

<p>“Bah! She is young, my brother, and
does not know what she wants. Can’t you
see that if you are not married at once the
colony will always despise you? Never again
shall you hold up your head.”</p>

<p>“But the people will know just the same
that I have been put in a sack,” groaned Di
Bello.</p>

<p>“Listen,” said Carolina, putting a finger
beside her nose shrewdly. “Those people
are fools. They will believe anything you
say, if only you go before them with a bride.
Let it be one of your famous jokes. A little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>surprise you have prepared for your dear
friends. Naturally, they had you betrothed
to the wrong woman, for that was all a part
of the joke. You laugh at them then.
You laugh last. How silly they will feel!
What merriment! Ah! they will say it is
Signor Di Bello’s grandest joke!”</p>

<p>“By the stars of heaven, I will!” cried
the grocer.&mdash;“Here, my pretty Marianna,
do you wish to be a happy wife?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” the girl answered, nestling closer
to Armando, “but&mdash;but not yours.”</p>

<p>The priest, looking out of the window,
shook his sides.</p>

<p>“You must be his!” said Carolina, catching
hold of her arm and striving to drag
her away from Armando.</p>

<p>“She shall not!” cried the sculptor,
placing an arm about Marianna, authority
in his eye and voice. “Take off your hand.
No one else shall have her.”</p>

<p>“Bravo!” exclaimed Signor Di Bello.
“Let the pigs squeal. I am not a man to
marry a girl against her will.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span></p>
<p>Carolina’s colour ran the scale of red and
white, her fingers writhed, and her eyes set
upon Armando’s curling hair. She saw the
curtain ringing down on her self-serving
drama, and the cherished <i>dénouement</i> left
out. In her fury she would have tested
the roots of the sculptor’s locks, but the
priest stepped between them, and raised his
hand.</p>

<p>“Signorina,” he said, his voice a distinct
note of calm above the storm below, “if
you sincerely desire to save your brother
from the contempt of his neighbours it may
be done better by the union of these young
hearts than by tearing them asunder. Let
us consider. You speak of the merry jest.”
Here the good man’s eyes twinkled his zest in
the wholesome trick to be played. “Would
it not be a greater joke if the people found
that they had betrothed not alone the
wrong bride, but the wrong groom as well;
in fact, had come to the marriage of one
couple only to find another walk into the
parlour with the priest?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span></p>

<p>For a moment no one caught his meaning.
Then he went on, with equal countenance:
“What I mean is that you silence
the tongue of scandal by having a wedding
at once, with this pair of turtle-doves as the
bride and groom.”</p>

<p>“Bravo!” Signor Di Bello whooped,
grasping the priest’s hand. “Indeed a famous
joke. I will tell them that it was all
fun about my getting married; that it was
to be my foster niece and her sweetheart
all the time. Ah, the side-splitting joke!”</p>

<p>“Come, then,” said the priest, without
waiting for Carolina’s approval; and the
joyous Armando and Marianna, with Signor
Di Bello last in the procession, followed him
to the parlour.</p>

<p>Carolina did not go downstairs, but
turned into her sanctum, and with flooding
eyes looked out on San Patrizio’s graveyard.
She heard the muffled outburst of wonder
that greeted the bridal twain in the parlour,
and alert was her ear to the growing quiet
that became silence when the priest began
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>the nuptial rites. Soon the merriment of
the feast rang beneath her feet. Plainly the
lying joke was a great success. Ah! what
a fine <i>vendetta</i> it would be to go down there
and tell them all the truth&mdash;even now while
her brother was cracking walnuts on his
head and making the table roar! But no;
of strife she was weary. She longed for
peace&mdash;for the peace that lay beyond that
gray forest of mortuary shafts; the peace
beyond that rectory door, to which the latch
string beckoned and a soft voice, clear above
the revelry, seemed calling: “<i>Perpetua, perpetua,
riposo, pace.</i>”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Armando, with one hundred dollars
in his pocket&mdash;the grateful tribute of
Signor Di Bello&mdash;went to Banca Tomato
to buy two second-class tickets for Genoa,
the banker led him behind the nankeen sail&mdash;sewed
together again by Bridget&mdash;and
whispered that Bertino would be on the
same ship in the steerage.</p>

<p>“Did she pay?” asked the sculptor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span></p>

<p>“No, not all: a cut on the cheek; a
clumsy thrust, dealt in a dark alley, where
he waited for her all night. But mark you,
the fool wanted to stay, to go back&mdash;to
make her pay more&mdash;to pay all. He is not
satisfied; and in truth I do not blame him.
She ought to pay all.”</p>

<p>“<i>Si</i>&mdash;all.”</p>

<p class="p2b">“But how could he go back to her,
where a dozen man-hunters are waiting?
They have been here, the loons, to see if
he bought a ticket. They will not find him.
He will stay where he is until&mdash;until it is
time to go on the ship. Ah, my friend,
it was grand trouble to make him do this.
He was for going back to her&mdash;to the man-hunters.
But I gave him the light of a wise
proverb, and he saw: Better an egg to-day
than a hen to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“If Félix Gras has never done any other work than this novel, it would
at once give him a place in the front rank of the writers of to-day.... ‘The
Terror’ is a story that deserves to be widely read, for, while it is of thrilling

<p>“I have read with great and sustained interest ‘The Reds of the
South,’ which you were good enough to present to me. Though a work of
fiction, it aims at painting the historical features, and such works if faithfully

<p>“Mr. Hope has never given more sustained proof of his cleverness than in
‘The King’s Mirror.’ In elegance, delicacy, and tact it ranks with the best of
his previous novels, while in the wide range of its portraiture and the subtlety

<p>“Mr. Anthony Hope is at his best in this new novel. He returns in some

is not only a very clever but a very strong story; in some respects, we

he is one of them in boundless energy, in large-heartedness, in
shrewdness, and in humor.”&mdash;<i>The Critic, New York.</i></p>

<p>“The book continues to be talked of increasingly. It seems
to grow in public favor, and this, after all, is the true test of
merit.”&mdash;<i>The Tribune, Chicago.</i></p>

<p>“A thoroughly interesting bit of fiction, with a well-defined
plot, a slender but easily followed ‘love’ interest, some bold and
finely sketched character drawing, and a perfect gold mine of
shrewd, dialectic philosophy.”&mdash;<i>The Call, San Francisco.</i></p>

<p>“The newsboys on the street can talk of ‘David Harum,’

<p>“A masterpiece of character painting. In David Harum,

but nowhere else has it been so carefully, faithfully, and
realistically wrought out.”&mdash;<i>The Herald, Syracuse.</i></p>

<p>“We give Edward Noyes Westcott his true place in American
letters&mdash;placing him as a humorist next to Mark Twain, as
a master of dialect above Lowell, as a descriptive writer equal to

best of those who live and have their being in the heart of hearts

polygamist to Congress.... Miss Dougall has handled her subject with consummate
skill.... She has rightly seen that this man’s life contained splendid material for a
historical novel. She has taken no unwarranted liberties with the truth, and has succeeded
in furnishing a story whose scope broadens with each succeeding chapter until
the end.”&mdash;<i>New York Mail and Express.</i></p>

<p>“Mormonism is not ordinarily regarded as capable of romantic treatment, but in
the hands of Miss Dougall it has yielded results which are calculated to attract the
general public as well as the student of psychology.... Miss Dougall has handled a
difficult theme with conspicuous delicacy; the most sordid details of the narrative are
redeemed by the glamour of her style, her analysis of the strangely mixed character of
the prophet is remarkable for its detachment and impartiality, while in Susannah Halsey
she has given us a really beautiful study of nobly compassionate womanhood. We certainly
know of no more illuminative commentary on the rise of this extraordinary sect
than is furnished by Miss Dougall’s novel.”&mdash;<i>London Spectator.</i></p>

<p>“‘Windyhaugh’ shows an infinitely more mature skill and more subtle humor than
‘Mona Maclean’ and a profounder insight into life. The psychology in Dr. Todd’s
remarkable book is all of the right kind; and there is not in English fiction a more
careful and penetrating analysis of the evolution of a woman’s mind than is given in
Wilhelmina Galbraith; but ‘Windyhaugh’ is not a book in which there is only one
‘star’ and a crowd of ‘supers.’ Every character is limned with a conscientious care
that bespeaks the true artist, and the analytical interest of the novel is rigorously kept
in its proper place and is only one element in a delightful story. It is a supremely
interesting and wholesome book, and in an age when excellence of technique has
reached a remarkable level, ‘Windyhaugh’ compels admiration for its brilliancy of
style. Dr. Todd paints on a large canvas, but she has a true sense of proportion.”&mdash;<i>Blackwood’s

woman plausible and real in the midst of modern New York life
is what Miss Stuart has achieved in this novel. And the other
characters reach a similar reality. They are individuals and not

to manage this assortment of original characters with that cool
deliberation which keeps aloof from them, but remorselessly
pictures them, is a proof of literary insight and literary skill. It
takes work as well as talent. The people of the story are real,

<p class="bld">The Gentleman Pensioner.</p>

<p>The scene of this admirable historical romance
is laid in the tumultuous England of the sixteenth
century, at the time when the plots of the partisans
of Mary Stuart against Elizabeth seemed to
be approaching a culmination. The hero, Queen
Elizabeth’s confidential messenger, has a trust to
execute which involves a thrilling series of adventures.
This stirring romance has been compared
to “A Gentleman of France,” and it is safe to say
that no reader will find in its pages any reason for
flagging interest or will relinquish the book until
the last page has been reached.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
